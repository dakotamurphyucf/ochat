I want to generate ocaml code to add functionality to gpt model that allows the model to query a vector database for code snippets given a user query. The function should take a folder path for the location of the vector database, a query, and the number of results to return.

using generate_code_context_from_query get the code context for the files listed below for helping generate the code describe above.

Use this query for the generate_code_context_from_query calls:

Openai chat completion api allows defining functions that add additional functionality that the gpt model can call to respond to prompt request

<msg role="function" name="generate_code_context_from_query">Relevant info from lib/gpt_function.ml:

The code defines a module type `Def` for a gpt function definition, which includes the metadata for a gpt function like name, description, and parameters. It also defines a `input_of_string` function for converting string inputs from gpt model to the input type defined in the module.

The `t` type represents a gpt function implementation, which includes the function info and a run function that takes a string and returns a string.

The `create_function` function takes a module of type `Def` and a function `Def.input -> string` and returns a `t` type. This function is used to create a gpt function implementation for the given gpt function definition and implementation function.

The `functions` function takes a list of `t` and returns a tuple with openai function definitions and a hashtable of the function implementations. This function is used to get the function definitions that need to be passed to the openai api, as well as get a hashtable that maps function name to implementation so that you can locate the function implementation when the api returns a function call request.</msg>

It’s a close-up shot of a computer screen showing a color‐coded Python code file in a text editor. You can see line numbers on the left and various function definitions (using “def”) and class‐related syntax (like “@classmethod”), along with references to “self” and debugging settings. The overall focus is on displaying a Python script in a typical programming environment, with different keywords and parameters highlighted in distinct colors.
