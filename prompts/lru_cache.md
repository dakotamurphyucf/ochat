I am trying to implement a configurable cache system for agent calls and document retreivals. given that agents can they themselves have depend other agents 
and that an agent is just a chat xml file itself each agent could possibly define its own cache configurations. The can cause a conflict when running the main conversation and you want the underlying agents to run fron scratch and not use a cache but the agent has itsown cache config and so it pulls from cache. Come up with a few ideas for workflows for how the cache system could operate

</msg>


<msg role="assistant">
	<raw>
		Below are several possible approaches for designing a configurable cache system in a scenario where “agents” themselves can spawn sub‐agents and each agent might have its own caching rules. The main tension is that sometimes you want the entire workflow to ignore caches (so everything is recomputed from scratch), but each agent might be configured to pull from a local or shared cache.
		
		1) Top‐Level “Global Policy” Override  
		   • Description: The main conversation/config has a single policy flag (e.g., “use_cache = true/false”), and this flag propagates down into each agent. No agent is allowed to override it.  
		   • Workflow:  
		     – At the beginning of the main conversation, you set use_cache = false to force every sub‐agent to skip caching, or use_cache = true to allow each agent to read/write caches as normal.  
		     – Agents that define their own cache settings must check the parent conversation’s policy and either skip their internal cache logic or proceed normally.  
		   • Pros: Simple to implement once the override check is enforced; you won’t end up with conflicting caching modes.  
		   • Cons: Agents lose autonomy over their own caching; if an agent genuinely needs local caching for performance, this approach might hamper it.
		
		2) Hierarchical Policy Composition  
		   • Description: The main conversation has a “cache policy” the user sets (e.g., “strict_nocache,” “allow_cache,” “force_refresh,” etc.). Sub‐agents read this parent policy and can attempt to combine it with their own.  
		   • Workflow:  
		     1. When the main conversation spawns or calls into a sub‐agent, it passes in a top‐level cache policy.  
		     2. The sub‐agent merges the parent policy with its own local configuration. The simplest approach:  
		        – If the parent says “strict_nocache,” then sub‐agent is forced to skip.  
		        – If the parent says “allow_cache,” the sub‐agent uses whatever TTL or limit it was configured with.  
		        – If the parent says “force_refresh,” the sub‐agent might flush its local entries (or only skip read but still write new entries).  
		     3. If the sub‐agent spawns another agent, it passes along the merged or (further) combined policy, ensuring a consistent top‐down flow.  
		   • Pros: More flexible than a “global override,” because sub‐agents can do partial caching or partial skipping based on a range of parent policies.  
		   • Cons: Slightly more complex to implement, as each agent must define how it merges “parent policy” with “local policy.”
		
		3) Agent‐Level Toggles + Global “Session” Parameter  
		   • Description: Each agent decides if it wants to rely on a cache or not, but the main conversation can set a special parameter (e.g. “session_id”) that effectively forces a fresh context. If the session_id changes, the agent’s local cache is ignored.  
		   • Workflow:  
		     1. The main conversation passes a session_id down with calls. If the user wants to “run from scratch,” a new random session_id is used. Agents see that the session_id does not match their known (cached) session and must recompute.  
		     2. Agents that do want to keep local caching can store results in a dataset keyed by (agent_config, session_id). If the session_id changes, they treat it as a cache miss.  
		     3. If you want to allow local caching, keep the same session_id. Agents will see the same session_id and can safely reuse results.  
		   • Pros: Straightforward to implement if each agent just sets “session_id” as part of its cache key. Running from scratch is as easy as changing the session_id on the main conversation.  
		   • Cons: Agents have to design their caches so they can handle multiple session_ids in parallel (could lead to bigger memory usage). If an agent wants to override the user’s session_id, that can be tricky to coordinate.
		
		4) Run‐In‐“Ephemeral Mode” vs. “Persistent Mode”  
		   • Description: Rather than strictly deciding “use cache or not,” you can have a short‐lived ephemeral cache for each run, which is always empty at the outset, and then scrapped after the conversation. If you want stable caching, switch to a persistent (on‐disk) or shared mode.  
		   • Workflow:  
		     1. If the main conversation is ephemeral_mode = true, then every agent automatically creates a brand‐new memory cache at the beginning of the run. Once the conversation or pipeline ends, the entire ephemeral cache is discarded.  
		     2. For persistent_mode, the main conversation plus the sub‐agents share a persistent store or read from local stores.  
		     3. The main conversation can unify ephemeral and persistent usage by letting each sub‐agent decide if it wants to “switch on” ephemeral or persistent for its own calls. But if the top level is ephemeral, it means no disk writes.  
		   • Pros: Simple conceptual distinction between ephemeral runs (like a scratch session) and persistent runs.  
		   • Cons: Doesn’t handle partial or selective caching all that easily—either everything is ephemeral or everything is persistent for that run.
		
		5) Manual “Reset Cache” Steps in the Pipeline  
		   • Description: A pipeline approach where you explicitly define steps or triggers to flush or bypass the cache, so even if an agent has its own caching config, you can dynamically decide to purge it.  
		   • Workflow:  
		     – For instance, <pipeline name="mainFlow">  
		         • <subtask function="callAgentA" args="useCache=true" />  
		         • <subtask function="flushCacheAgentA" />  <!-- agentA function that empties or bypasses cache -->  
		         • <subtask function="callAgentA" args="useCache=false" />  
		       </pipeline>  
		     – The idea is that you “manually” coordinate which calls should read/write the cache and which should skip or flush.  
		   • Pros: Fine‐grained control at each step; you can highlight exactly which calls are repeated or forced fresh.  
		   • Cons: Easy to become messy if you have many sub‐agents or multiple nested calls. You have to script the flushes/overrides in the pipeline every time you want a fresh run.
		
		Summary  
		• In practice, many teams use a hybrid approach. They’ll have a top‐level policy that strongly influences an agent’s caching, but also provide either ephemeral session IDs or pipeline flush steps when needed.  
		• If you want the simplest solution, adopt either the “Top‐Level Global Override” or the “Hierarchical Policy Composition” pattern. Both let the main conversation forcibly ignore caches without having to remove caching code from the sub‐agents.  
		• If you need advanced partial caching or “fresh for some calls, cached for others,” either the pipeline flush approach or the ephemeral session approach can help.  
		• The key is ensuring that each agent is prepared to receive a “no_cache” (or similar) instruction from the parent config, so that you don’t end up with contradictory policies at runtime.

So I think its better to think of agents as just another conversation thread just like the main thread. The agent itself will be statically defined and its configs including its possible cache configs. So as a user when I send a new message in the main thread the runtime reads the main thread file and gets it message history via the msg elements. If the element has img/doc/agent elements then that msg is dynamically constructed. This operation can be expensive and depending on what the user interacting with the conversation wants they may want the vaule of the dynamic message cached for the next call. An agent might also want certain things cached like maybe fetched data that only updates periodically and so it would not make sense for the cache to be invalidated. Maybe the main thread could define override configs by defining an ovveride element that has the src of the agent and the configs to be overrided. Come up with some more approaches given what I just shared

	<raw>
		Below are some additional ideas and possible approaches for making “agents” just another conversation thread with their own static definitions (including cache configs), while still allowing the main thread to override or refine those cache rules:
		
		1) Layered “Override Elements” in the Main Conversation  
		   • Concept: Just as you suggested, the main conversation could include special <override> blocks that explicitly patch or override an agent’s configuration before spawning it.  
		   • Example XML:  
		     <override target="agentA" cache_ttl="1h" use_cache="false" />  
		     <msg role="user">  
		       <callAgent agent="agentA">  
		         Here is some text that needs specialized processing.  
		       </callAgent>  
		     </msg>  
		   • Implementation:  
		     – At runtime, the system reads the <override> blocks, looks up the “agentA” config, and merges any override attributes (e.g. “cache_ttl,” “use_cache,” “max_size,” etc.) into agentA’s config.  
		     – Then, when agentA is called, it respects these new or modified config values (e.g. ignoring its own “cache” setting if overwritten).  
		   • Pros: Very direct—the main conversation can selectively control sub‐agent caching rules; you see exactly when and how they get changed.  
		   • Cons: Overriding many config fields across multiple sub‐agents can become verbose; you need a merging strategy for conflicting keys.
		
		2) “Materialized” Sub‐Messages With Stale Check  
		   • Concept: For each doc/img/agent reference, the system “materializes” (i.e. fetches or generates) the content once and caches it as a short‐term snapshot (either in memory or on disk). The agent’s own config can define a “stale interval” (like only update every 30 minutes).  
		   • Example Workflow:  
		     – The main conversation sees <img src="http://example.com/diagram.png" cache="true" stale_interval="30m" />.  
		     – The runtime looks for a materialized version (like a local file or a memory entry). If not found or if older than 30 minutes, it refetches.  
		     – The agent itself might define the same or additional stale intervals for its own doc retrieval.  
		   • Handling Overrides:  
		     – If the user wants “no caching” on the next run, the main conversation could in an <override> or a pipeline step explicitly say “stale_interval = 0” or “fresh_fetch=true.”  
		   • Pros: This approach is fairly modular—the system deals with large doc/img fetches in a uniform way, and sub‐agents can define their own refresh intervals.  
		   • Cons: You still need a mechanism to override or forcibly re‐fetch if a certain piece of data shouldn’t be reused.
		
		3) Per‐Agent “Cache Profile” Files + Session “Mode”  
		   • Concept: Each agent has a small “profile” file that defines how it caches (TTL, disk vs. memory, etc.). The main conversation can specify a global “cache mode” in the session (e.g., “production,” “dev_fresh,” or “manual_test”) that the agent’s profile references.  
		   • Example Implementation:  
		     – agentA_profile.xml:  
		       <profile>  
		         <cacheParam mode="production" ttl="24h" />  
		         <cacheParam mode="dev_fresh" use_cache="false" />  
		         <cacheParam mode="manual_test" ttl="10m" />  
		       </profile>  
		     – The main conversation sets a “mode=dev_fresh” in its top‐level config.  
		     – When agentA is called, it sees mode=dev_fresh → uses “use_cache=false” from the profile.  
		   • Pros: Fairly clean separation; each agent’s caching logic is still in its own file, but overrides come from a single “mode” attribute—no manual rewriting.  
		   • Cons: Requires a known set of “modes”; if you need more granular overrides, you’ll have to expand the profile system.
		
		4) On‐Demand “Warm” and “Discard” Steps  
		   • Concept: You treat each <agent> or <doc> reference like a mini “function call.” You can either “warm the cache” or “discard” it based on the user’s current preference.  
		   • Example:  
		     –
		       <pipeline name="testingAgentCalls">  
		         <subtask function="warmCache" agent="agentA" doc="data/report.csv" />  
		         <subtask function="callAgent" agent="agentA" recheck="false" />  
		         <subtask function="discardCache" agent="agentA" />  
		       </pipeline>  
		   • Implementation:  
		     – The system orchestrates these tasks in order, so you can precisely indicate which calls should be cached and which should be recalculated.  
		   • Pros: Very explicit control.  
		   • Cons: Potentially verbose. The user must script every “warm” and “discard” step in the pipeline.
		
		5) “Deferred Resolution” + Caching Hooks  
		   • Concept: Instead of immediately materializing <img>, <doc>, or <agent> references, the conversation engine collects them into a plan. Then, right before the final request to the LLM, it either fetches or loads from cache.  
		   • Implementation:  
		     – The weaving engine sees: <msg role="user">some text… <doc src="x"/> <agent src="agentA.xml"/>…</msg>.  
		     – It defers resolution until it has read any override elements or top‐level settings (e.g., <override target="agentA" use_cache="false" />).  
		     – Then it runs a “resolve step” that processes each reference in turn, skipping or using the cache based on the final merged config.  
		   • Pros: You can gather all overrides first, apply them, and then fetch data or call sub‐agents. This ensures you don’t do partial fetches in the wrong mode.  
		   • Cons: Slightly more complex engine logic—a two‐pass approach (parse overrides → then resolve references).
		
		Summary  
		• All of the approaches revolve around clearly defining how the main conversation’s config (or the user’s immediate desire) merges or overrides the agent’s pre‐defined caching rules.  
		• You can keep your agent definitions static (with their own caching config) but still allow the main thread to alter them at runtime via override tags, pipeline steps, or a “mode” system.  
		• The best method depends on how often you need to override, how “clean” you want the user’s XML to be, and whether you prefer explicit (e.g., pipeline steps) or implicit (e.g., inherited “mode” flags) control.
