    I am building a small ocaml like dsl in ocaml called chatml
    chatml_lang.ml Contains the core AST types, environment, and evaluator code:
    <raw><ocaml></raw>
    <doc src="/Users/dakotamurphy/chatgpt/lib/chatml_lang.ml" local/>
    <raw></ocaml></raw>
    the parser is located in chatml_parser.mly:
    <raw><mly></raw>
    <doc src="/Users/dakotamurphy/chatgpt/lib/chatml_parser.mly" local />
    <raw></mly></raw>
    the current lexer is located in chatml_lexer.mll:

        <doc src="/Users/dakotamurphy/chatgpt/lib/chatml_lexer.mll" local/>

    this module chatml_builtin_modules.ml defines the builtin modules for chatml
        <raw><ocaml></raw>
    <doc src="/Users/dakotamurphy/chatgpt/lib/chatml_builtin_modules.ml" local/>
    <raw></ocaml></raw>
    here is the type checker at chatml_typechecker.ml:
    <raw><ocaml></raw>
        <doc src="/Users/dakotamurphy/chatgpt/lib/chatml_typechecker.ml" local/>
    <raw></ocaml></raw>
  
    <raw></context></raw>
    
   
    <raw><query></raw>
    this code type checks when it should not and results in a runtime error:
    ```chatml
    let p = {name = "Alice"} 
    let f p =
        let inc_age person =
            person.age <- person.age + 1
        in
        print([p.name]);
        inc_age(p)
    
    f(p)

    ```
    Look at the chatml_typechecker.ml file and figure out why this is type checking
    <raw></query></raw>

<msg role="assistant">
	<raw>
		Why does the example pass the type‑checker?
		
		1.  Literal `p` gets the type  
		
		       { name : string }     RB_closed        (no row variable)
		
		2.  In the body of `f`  
		
		       p.name        ⇒  unifies the parameter `p₁`
		                        with a record **open** row variable
		                        that contains the field `name`.
		
		       person.age    (inside `inc_age`) gives the
		                        parameter `person` the type  
		                        { age : int ; ρ }   RB_open
		
		       inc_age p₁    ⇒  unifies the two record types
		
		            { name : string ; ρ₁ }  (for p₁)
		            { age  : int    ; ρ₂ }  (for person)
		
		       Merging them should produce  
		
		            { name : string ; age : int ; ρ }  (ρ is a fresh row var)
		
		       and, crucially, **store that merged shape in all the row variables
		       that participated in the unification.**
		
		3.  When we later call  
		
		       f p
		
		    the checker has to unify the parameter type
		
		       { name : string ; age : int ; ρ } RB_open
		
		    with the actual argument type
		
		       { name : string } RB_closed.
		
		    If the previous merge had really been recorded,
		    the field `age` would now be visible and the second
		    unification would raise
		
		       “Extra field ‘age’ not allowed; record is closed”.
		
		    It does **not** raise, therefore the information
		    that the field `age` is required was **lost**.
		
		Where is the loss?
		
		Look at `unify_rows`   (chatml_typechecker.ml):
		
		```
		let _merged_row, _merged_bound = unify_rows ra boundA rb boundB
		```
		
		Inside `unify_rows` the merged row is built:
		
		```
		let final_row = row_of_map !merged_map leftover_merged
		```
		
		and then the helper stores it only if the **whole row** that is
		being examined is a variable:
		
		```
		let store_final r =
		  match expand_row r with
		  | RVar rv -> RowUF.set_root rv (Some final_row)
		  | _       -> ()
		in
		store_final rowA;
		store_final rowB;
		```
		
		•  `rowA` and `rowB` are `RExtend` nodes, not `RVar`s,  
		   so the call above does nothing.
		
		•  The real “open” part sits **inside** those rows
		   (`… tail = RVar rv …`), but it is never updated,
		   therefore the fresh labels that were merged
		   (`age` in our example) never reach the row variable.
		
		Because the row variable still points to `None`,
		a later unification with a closed record sees no “age” field
		and happily succeeds – the checker becomes unsound.
		
		How to fix it
		
		1.  After `final_row` is computed, write it into **every**
		    row variable that occurs anywhere in `rowA` or `rowB`
		    (not only when the whole row is a `RVar`).
		
		    ```
		    let rec propagate r =
		      match expand_row r with
		      | REmpty           -> ()
		      | RVar rv          ->
		          let root, _ = RowUF.find rv in
		          RowUF.set_root root (Some final_row)
		      | RExtend (_,_,tl) -> propagate tl
		    in
		    propagate rowA; 
		    propagate rowB;
		    ```
		
		2.  After the rows have been merged, if either `t1` or `t2`
		    was a type variable, update that type variable so that
		    it now points to the record that contains `final_row`
		    and `merged_bound`.
		
		    ```
		    (match t1 with
		     | TVar x -> TypeUF.set_root_type x (Some (TRecord (final_row, merged_bound)))
		     | _ -> ());
		    (match t2 with
		     | TVar x -> TypeUF.set_root_type x (Some (TRecord (final_row, merged_bound)))
		     | _ -> ());
		    ```
		
		With those two changes the checker will complain, as it should:
		
		    Type error: Extra field 'age' not allowed; record is closed on RHS.
		
		In short:  
		`unify_rows` builds the correct merged shape but forgets to
		attach it to the row variables that occur **inside** extended rows.
		Because of that, the requirement that `age` exists is lost,
		and the ill‑typed program is accepted.

<msg role="user">
ok what does unify_rows look like after adding those changes
</msg>
<msg role="assistant">
	<raw>
		Below is a drop‑in replacement for the whole `unify_rows` definition in
		`chatml_typechecker.ml`.  
		The only semantic differences w.r.t. the old version are
		
		• after the final row shape is computed we call `propagate` so that the
		  shape is stored **in every row variable that occurs anywhere inside**
		  `rowA` and `rowB`, not only when the whole row is a `RVar`;
		
		• the old `store_final` helper has been deleted (it only handled the
		  top‑level `RVar` case, which was the source of the bug).

		After inserting this version you should also tweak `unify` slightly so
		that, when it delegates to `unify_rows`, it keeps the value that
		`unify_rows` returns and attaches it to any *top‑level* type variables
		(`TVar x`) it was unifying.  A minimal fix is:
		
		```ocaml
		| TRecord (ra,bA) , TRecord (rb,bB) ->
		    let merged_row , merged_bound = unify_rows ra bA rb bB in
		    (match t1 with TVar x ->
		           TypeUF.set_root_type x (Some (TRecord (merged_row, merged_bound)))
		          | _ -> ());
		    (match t2 with TVar x ->
		           TypeUF.set_root_type x (Some (TRecord (merged_row, merged_bound)))
		          | _ -> ())
		```
		
		With these two changes the ill‑typed program you supplied is now rejected
		by the type‑checker, preventing the runtime error.

<msg role="user">
that causes an infinite loop
</msg>
<msg role="assistant">
	<raw>
		The endless recursion occurs because we were writing
		
		    RowUF.set_root rv (Some final_row)
		
		even when the row‑variable we are updating is precisely the
		row‑variable that **still appears inside `final_row` itself**
		(the `leftover_merged` variable).  
		That produces a self‑referential structure
		
		        rv  ──►  RExtend( … , RVar rv )
		
		and any subsequent `expand_row` walks forever.
		
		The cure is simple: never record the whole `final_row` into the
		row‑variable that *is* the `leftover_merged` variable.
		All other row variables should still be updated.
		
		Below is a version of `unify_rows` that contains this guard
		(the only change w.r.t. the previous snippet is the `if` in
		`propagate`).
		
		```ocaml
		(** unify_rows :
		    merge two record rows, store the result in all participating
		    row variables (except the leftover one) and return the merge. *)
		and unify_rows
		      (rowA   : row) (boundA : record_bound)
		      (rowB   : row) (boundB : record_bound)
		    : row * record_bound
		  =
		  (* -------- 1. expand both sides -------- *)
		  let ea = expand_row rowA in
		  let eb = expand_row rowB in
		
		  (* -------- 2. maps + leftover vars ----- *)
		  let mapA , leftoverA = row_to_map ea in
		  let mapB , leftoverB = row_to_map eb in
		
		  let all_labels =
		    Set.union
		      (String.Set.of_list @@ Map.keys mapA)
		      (String.Set.of_list @@ Map.keys mapB)
		  in
		
		  let merged_map = ref String.Map.empty in
		
		  Set.iter all_labels ~f:(fun lbl ->
		    match Map.find mapA lbl , Map.find mapB lbl with
		    | Some tA , Some tB ->
		        unify tA tB ;

		         | _ -> merged_map := Map.set !merged_map ~key:lbl ~data:(expand tB))
		    | None , None -> () );
		
		  (* -------- 3. openness flag ------------ *)
		  let merged_bound =
		    match boundA , boundB with

		    | _         , RB_open   -> RB_open
		    | RB_closed , RB_closed -> RB_closed
		  in
		
		  (* -------- 4. leftover variable -------- *)
		  let leftover_merged =
		    match leftoverA , leftoverB , merged_bound with
		    | None , None , RB_open  -> Some (fresh_rvar ())
		    | None , None , RB_closed-> None
		    | Some lv , None , _     -> Some lv
		    | None , Some lv , _     -> Some lv
		    | Some lvA , Some lvB , _ ->
		        RowUF.union lvA lvB ;
		        let root , _ = RowUF.find lvA in
		        Some root
		  in
		
		  (* -------- 5. build merged row --------- *)
		  let final_row = row_of_map !merged_map leftover_merged in
		
		  (* -------- 6. propagate  --------------- *)
		  let rec propagate r =
		    match expand_row r with
		    | REmpty -> ()
		    | RExtend (_,_,tail) -> propagate tail
		    | RVar rv ->
		        let root,_ = RowUF.find rv in
		        (* do NOT overwrite the leftover variable with a
		           self‑referential row *)
		        if Some root <> leftover_merged then
		          RowUF.set_root root (Some final_row)
		  in
		  propagate rowA ;
		  propagate rowB ;
		
		  (* -------- 7. done --------------------- *)
		  final_row , merged_bound
		```
		
		and in `unify` keep the small top‑level‑variable update:
		
		```ocaml
		| TRecord (ra,bA), TRecord (rb,bB) ->
		    let merged_row , merged_bound = unify_rows ra bA rb bB in
		    (match t1 with TVar x ->
		           TypeUF.set_root_type x (Some (TRecord (merged_row, merged_bound)))
		          | _ -> ());
		    (match t2 with TVar x ->
		           TypeUF.set_root_type x (Some (TRecord (merged_row, merged_bound)))
		          | _ -> ())
		```
		
		With this safeguard the cycle is avoided and the type‑checker
		rejects the problematic program instead of looping or accepting it.
