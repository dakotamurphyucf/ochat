is it possible to use a command line application that accesses the file system and does not build on windows with the use of docker? The user would provide local file paths on the host machine and the docker image would need to be able to pull those files from the host machine
</msg>

		Yes, you can make this work using Docker volumes. When running a container, you can “mount” host-machine directories into the container’s file system. Here is a broad overview of how you might set it up:
		
		1. Build a Docker image with any dependencies your command-line application requires (for example, a Linux-based image if the application is not compiled for Windows).
		2. Run the container while specifying a volume mount from your host filesystem to a path inside the container.
		
		For example, if you have:
		• Source files on your local Windows machine under C:\myapp
		• A Docker container that expects its input files under /app
		
		Then you could run a command such as:
		docker run --rm -v C:\myapp:/app myimage:latest [your command]
		
		Inside the container, /app maps to C:\myapp on the host. You can then operate on those files from within the container environment, even though they reside on the host’s Windows file system. This allows you to run a Linux-based command-line tool inside Docker against files stored on a Windows host, without worrying about building it on Windows directly.

what if I want the paths to be the same
</msg>
<msg role="assistant">
	<raw>
		If you want your container to see and use exactly the same path string as your host (e.g., C:\myapp inside the container matching C:\myapp on your Windows machine), you need to run a Windows-based container rather than a Linux-based one. In other words:
		
		• Linux-based containers interpret file paths as /... (no drive letters).  
		• Windows-based containers can interpret file paths like C:\... directly.
		
		Below is a high-level approach to preserve the same path in a Windows-based container:
		
		1. In your Dockerfile, start with a Windows base image, for example:  
		   FROM mcr.microsoft.com/windows:1809
		
		2. When you run the container, mount the same path you have on the host. For instance:  
		   docker run --rm -v C:\myapp:C:\myapp <your-windows-image> <command>
		
		   Inside the container, C:\myapp maps directly to the host’s C:\myapp, so all (Windows) file paths match exactly.
		
		If you need a Linux-based container, you cannot literally use C:\myapp for the container paths because Linux does not recognize Windows drive letters. Instead, you typically do something like:  
		docker run --rm -v C:\myapp:/app <your-linux-image> <command>
		
		Inside the container you must access those files via /app, not C:\myapp.

I beleive that windows applications can read normal file paths as well
</msg>
<msg role="assistant">
	<raw>
		Windows can often handle paths using forward slashes or backslashes (for example, C:/myapp can work in many contexts on Windows just like C:\myapp). However, when discussing Docker, the key difference is not just about slash vs. backslash—it’s about which operating system (Windows vs. Linux) the container is running on and how Docker mounts host directories into the container:
		
		1. On Windows-based containers, you can use Windows-style absolute paths (C:\myapp). By mounting with docker run -v C:\myapp:C:\myapp …, the container sees the host path as-is, including the Windows drive letter.  
		2. On Linux-based containers, paths inside the container look like /app, /home, etc. Even if you specify the host path as C:\myapp in your -v or --mount argument, once inside the container, it will be /app (or whichever mount point you choose).
		
		So while Windows itself can interpret various path styles, you still have to align with how Docker mounts volumes and how the container OS expects to see those paths. If you truly want to preserve the exact “C:\myapp” path inside the container, you’ll need a Windows-based container. Otherwise, you can run a Linux-based container and mount the Windows path (C:\myapp) to some Linux-like path (e.g., /app), then access it inside the container under /app.
