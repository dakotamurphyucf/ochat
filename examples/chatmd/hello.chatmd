Hello!  Could you explain what ChatMD is and why it exists?

<assistant>
Certainly – ChatMD (Chat Markdown) is a small XML-like language used in this
repository to write prompts for large language models.  It provides:

* **Explicit roles** – `<user>`, `<assistant>`, `<system>` …
* **Embedded tools** – `<tool_call>`, `<tool_response>`
* **Rich snippets** – `<doc>` for code / odoc extracts, `<img>` for pictures.

Because roles and boundaries are explicit, our runtime can shuffle messages,
stream tool responses, and render pretty UIs while still achieving
loss-less round-tripping of the original text.
