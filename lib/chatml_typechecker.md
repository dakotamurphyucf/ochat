### Overview

The file `chatml_typechecker.ml` implements a type inference system, based on a unification algorithm, for the Chatml DSL. It supports:

- **Primitive types**: `int`, `bool`, `float`, `string`, `unit`
- **Type variables**: which will be unified as the program is inferred
- **Function types**: represented by `TFun (arg_types, return_type)`
- **Variant types** (polymorphic variants): e.g. `` `Tag(...) ``
- **Records** with extensible rows
- **Arrays**
- **Modules** (more simplified checking)
- **Dynamic type** (i.e., a universal “fallback”)

The file is divided into major sections:

1. **Type Representation** – the data structures that store types and partial information (e.g., row variables for open records).
2. **Union-Find Structures** – the low-level mechanism for equating unknown type variables via unification.
3. **Unification** – the algorithm that merges types when they must match.  
4. **Type Inference** – a function `infer_expr` that calculates the type of each expression, hooking into unification.  
5. **Support for patterns, statements, and full program checking** – handling of pattern-matching, let bindings, modules, etc.

We’ll walk through each piece below.

---
## 2 Type Representation
The core of the type system lives in the definition:

```ocaml
type poly_row_bound =
    | Exact
    | AtLeast
    | AtMost

type row =
    | REmpty
    | RExtend of string * ttype * row
    | RVar of int

and poly_row = {
    bound : poly_row_bound;
    tags : (string * ttype list) list;
    leftover : int option;
}

and ttype =
    | TInt
    | TBool
    | TFloat
    | TString
    | TUnit
    | TVar of int
    | TFun of ttype list * ttype
    | TArray of ttype
    | TPolyVariant of poly_row
    | TRecord of row
    | TModule of (string * scheme) list
    | TDynamic

and scheme = Scheme of int list * ttype
```

### 2.1 Primitive Types
- `TInt`, `TBool`, `TFloat`, `TString`, `TUnit`: The usual suspects.

### 2.2 Type Variables
- `TVar of int`: Represents an unknown type. As the typechecker runs, type variables become linked to more concrete types or to other type variables via unification.

### 2.3 Function Types
- `TFun of ttype list * ttype`: A function type from `arg_1 * arg_2 * ...` to a return type. For example, `TFun ([TInt; TFloat], TBool)` is a function taking an `int` and a `float` and returning a `bool`.

### 2.4 Rows for Records
- `TRecord of row`: A record type is built from a “row.” A row can be:
    - `REmpty`: A closed, empty record (i.e., `{ }`).
    - `RExtend (label, field_type, tail)`: A record that has one field and a tail row. For example, `RExtend("name", TString, REmpty)` is a record with a single string field `name`.
    - `RVar of int`: A row variable that indicates an open portion of the record. This lets records be “open” or extendable.

### 2.5 Polymorphic Variant Rows
- `TPolyVariant of poly_row`: A polymorphic variant has a set of possible tags, each with its argument types, and optional “bound” restrictions:
    - `bound` can be `Exact`, `AtLeast`, or `AtMost`.
    - `tags` is the list of `(tag, [arg_types])`.
    - `leftover` is an optional integer referencing a union-find variable to track leftover possibilities (for open variants).

A polymorphic variant might look like `[> `X(int) | `Y(bool, float)]` in some ML-like syntax. The row representation keeps track of exactly which tags are known, whether more tags are allowed, or if some tags are disallowed.

### 2.6 Schemes
A `scheme` is `(Scheme (bound_type_vars, body_type))`, capturing universal quantification over certain type variables. If your environment says `x` has type `Scheme ( [0], TFun([TVar 1], TVar 0))`, that means “`x` is polymorphic in type variables 0, 1, etc.”. When you retrieve it, you “instantiate” those type variables with fresh ones.

### 2.7 Dynamic Type
- `TDynamic`: Treated as “universal,” meaning it unifies freely with any other type (a pragmatic fallback type).

---
## 3 Union-Find Structures
The file uses three separate union-find data structures, each specialized for a different kind of variable:

1. **`TypeUF`**: For normal type variables `TVar of int`.  
2. **`RowUF`**: For row variables `RVar of int`, used in the record representation.  
3. **`PolyVarUF`**: For leftover variant row variables `leftover : int option` in `poly_row`.

### 3.1 How Union-Find Works in General
A union-find structure is basically:
- A set of elements that can be merged (unioned) to indicate they represent “the same thing.”  
- A “find” operation that returns a canonical representative for each element.  

When we unify `TVar 3` with “an actual type,” we record that variable 3’s canonical type is the actual type. If we unify `TVar 3` with `TVar 5`, we unify their representatives in the union-find data structure so that they refer to the same root.

### 3.2 `TypeUF`
```ocaml
module TypeUF = struct
    ...
end
```
- It stores a `node` which can be either `Link of int` (points to another ID) or `Root of ttype option`.
- If `Root of None`, the type variable is not yet fully resolved. If `Root of Some t`, it’s partially resolved to a real type (which itself could still have type variables in it, i.e. partial progress).
- `find x` traverses links until it finds a root, compressing paths along the way.

### 3.3 `RowUF` 
Same concept, but each node tracks `row option` instead of `ttype option`. A row variable can unify with another row variable or with a known row structure.

### 3.4 `PolyVarUF`
Again, the same pattern but specialized for `poly_row`.

---
## 4) Expansion (`expand` and `expand_row`)
During unification, a type variable might become linked to a partial type or another variable, and so on. The function `expand` “chases” these links until it obtains the most concrete form. It also updates union-find to collapse stale links, so repeated expansions become faster.

```ocaml
let rec expand (ty : ttype) : ttype =
    match ty with
    | TVar tv ->
    let rid, maybe_ty = TypeUF.find tv in
    (* ... *)
    | TFun (args, ret) -> TFun (List.map ~f:expand args, expand ret)
    | TRecord row -> TRecord (expand_row row)
    | TPolyVariant pv -> TPolyVariant (expand_poly_row pv)
    | (* ... *)
```

### 4.1 `expand_row`
```ocaml
let rec expand_row (r : row) : row =
    match r with
    | RVar rv ->
    let root, ropt = RowUF.find rv in
    ...
    ...
```
Similar idea, but for record row variables.

### 4.2 `expand_poly_row`
Polymorphic variants can contain leftover row variables (like open variant sets). The function `expand_poly_row` also merges leftover entries if multiple expansions happen.

---
## 5 The Unification Algorithm
The main logic is in:

```ocaml
let rec unify (t1 : ttype) (t2 : ttype) : unit = ...
```

Unification tries to make `t1` and `t2` the same type. The steps:

1. **Expand** both `t1` and `t2`. This ensures we deal in canonical (already partially resolved) forms.
2. If either is `TDynamic`, we do nothing (they unify trivially).
3. If both are the same constructor (e.g., `TInt`, `TInt`), fine.
4. If `TVar x` vs. `TVar y`, unify their union-find representatives.
5. If `TVar x` vs. some other type `T`, record in the union-find that `x` now points to `T`.
6. If `TFun(a1, r1)` vs. `TFun(a2, r2)`, unify each pair `(a1[i], a2[i])` and unify `r1, r2`.
7. If `TRecord rA` vs. `TRecord rB`, unify rows (handled with `unify_rows`).
8. If `TPolyVariant pvA` vs. `TPolyVariant pvB`, unify them with `unify_poly_variant_rows`.
9. Otherwise, fail with a `Type_error`.

### 5.1 Record Unification
Records are implemented as maps of label-to-type plus a possible “open tail.” The function `unify_rows` calls `row_to_map` to produce `(Map<label, type>, leftover_row_variable_option)` for each side. Then it checks all labels, merges them, and tries to unify leftover row variables if the record is open.

### 5.2 Polymorphic Variant Unification
Similar approach, but it merges sets of tags. If a tag appears on both sides, it unifies the types of the tag’s arguments. It also merges leftover variant row variables if both sides have an open leftover.

---
## 6 Free Type Variables, Schemes, Instantiation, and Generalization
In a language with let-polymorphism, each function can be polymorphic in the type variables that do not appear in the environment.

- **`free_tvars ty`**: Gathers all unbound type variables in `ty`.
- **`free_tvars_scheme (Scheme (bvs, body))`**: Looks at the body of the scheme but removes the bound variables `bvs`.
- **`free_tvars_env env`**: Union of free variables of all symbols in the environment.

### 6.1 Generalization
When we do `let x = expr in ...`, we compute the type `ty` of `expr` and then create a scheme that universally quantifies over the type variables not forced by the environment. That is:
```ocaml
let generalize (env : (string, scheme) Hashtbl.t) (ty : ttype) : scheme =
    let fv_env = free_tvars_env env in
    let fv_ty = free_tvars ty in
    let gen_vars = Set.diff fv_ty fv_env in
    Scheme (Set.to_list gen_vars, ty)
```
Hence if `ty` has a variable that also appears free in the environment, we cannot generalize it.

### 6.2 Instantiation
When we see `x` and find that `x` has scheme `Scheme (bvars, body)`, we create fresh variables for each bound variable `bvars`:
```ocaml
let instantiate (Scheme (bvars, body)) : ttype = ...
```
Effectively turning them into a new `TVar`.

---
## 7) Expression Inference
**`infer_expr env e`**:
- For a literal (int, bool, etc.), we return a primitive type like `TInt`.
- For `EVar x`, we look up `x` in the environment, retrieving its scheme, and instantiate it.
- For a function definition `ELambda (params, body)`, we assign each parameter a fresh type variable, bind them in a local environment, infer the body’s type, and produce `TFun (param_types, body_type)`.
- For function application `EApp(fn, args)`, we:
    1. Infer the type of `fn`.
    2. Infer each argument’s type.
    3. Create a fresh variable for the result type.
    4. Unify `fn_type` with `TFun (arg_types, result_var)`.
    5. Return `result_var`.
- For `EIf (cond, thenE, elseE)`, we unify the condition with `TBool`, unify the types of `thenE` and `elseE`, and return that unified type.
- And similarly for other expressions: arrays, records, references, pattern-matching, etc.

Constraints discovered along the way are solved by calls to `unify`. This is the essence of an ML-style type inference.

---
## 8 Pattern Matching
Within `EMatch (scrut_expr, cases)`, we do:
1. Infer the scrutinee’s type, call it `s_ty`.
2. Create a fresh `result_ty`.
3. For each `(pattern, rhs_expr)`:
    - Infer the pattern’s type `pat_ty` in a local environment.
    - Unify `s_ty` with `pat_ty`.
    - Infer `rhs_expr` → `rhs_ty`.
    - Unify `rhs_ty` with `result_ty`.
4. Return `result_ty`.

The pattern inference `infer_pattern` itself is fairly straightforward: a variable pattern introduces a new type variable in the environment, an integer pattern is `TInt`, a variant pattern introduces a `TPolyVariant` with specific tags, etc.

---
## 9 Statement Inference
**`infer_stmt env s`** handles top-level constructs:

- `SLet (x, e)`: Infer `e` → `ty`, then generalize to form a scheme, store `x` in the environment.
- `SLetRec bindings`: For each `x` in the binding, allocate a fresh `TVar`. Then unify them with the actual type of their right-hand side expressions. This handles recursive functions so that each definition is visible for the others.
- `SModule (mname, stmts)`: Create a copy of the environment, run all statements, then gather the new definitions in that environment as a `TModule`. Store that module in the original environment with name `mname`.
- `SOpen mname`: (not implemented in detail here, but normally you’d merge module definitions into the current scope).
- `SExpr e`: Infer and discard, used for top-level expressions.

---
## 10 Builtins and Entry to the Type Checker
Finally, we load some builtins into the type environment:

```ocaml
let add_builtins (env : (string, scheme) Hashtbl.t) : unit = ...
```
We insert known functions like `print`, `to_string`, and numeric operators with appropriate function types. These are generalized so that code can use them in different contexts.

**`infer_program prog`** is the main entry point:
1. Create an empty environment.
2. Add builtins.
3. Infer each statement in `prog`.  
If any `Type_error` arises, we exit with an error message.

---
## 11 Putting It All Together
Overall, here’s how the checker flows:

1. **Initialization**: We define all the type representations, with union-find structures to handle partial, un-unified states.  
2. **Type Inference**: Walk the AST, assigning new type variables where needed. Each step triggers unifications that might further refine types.  
3. **Unification**: The unify function merges constraints, ensuring consistent types across the AST.  
4. **Generalization**: After we infer a top-level let binding, we find which type variables can be turned into universally quantified ones.  
5. **Expand**: Used repeatedly to “follow the chain” for partial type variables and collapse them for better efficiency.  
6. **Error Handling**: If a unification fails because the types are truly incompatible, we report a `Type_error`.  

The code ultimately ensures that every expression is well-typed and that the final environment can represent any polymorphism. This approach is built around the classic Hindley–Milner style type inference, extended to handle records, variants, arrays, and modules.

---

### Key Takeaways
- **Union-find** is the backbone of a flexible type inference system, letting type variables unify incrementally. 
- **Rows** and **polymorphic variants** are advanced features that require distinct union-find mechanisms for row variables. They’re quite powerful for implementing open/closed record or variant systems.  
- **Generalization** and **instantiation** control the “polymorphic” aspect of `let` bindings so that a single definition can be used at multiple different types.  
- The code is heavily reliant on **path compression** in union-find and repeated `expand` to keep the structure as simple (and fast) as possible once constraints accumulate.

---

This completes the overview and detailed walkthrough of `chatml_typechecker.ml`. It is an excellent reference for anyone contributing to or studying the project. The design demonstrates key concepts in type theory (unification, row types, polymorphic variants, and let-polymorphism) in a real, working typechecker.



### Detailed Docs for sections of the code

## 1) The Role of Union-Find in the Typechecker

Union-Find (also known as Disjoint Set Union, DSU) is a data structure that efficiently merges sets (unifying multiple elements) and finds each set’s canonical “representative.” In a typechecking context, whenever two types (or rows, or polymorphic variant rows) must be the same, we unify them by merging their union-find entries. 

Here, we use three distinct union-find modules:
1. **`TypeUF`** — for type variables (`TVar of int`).
2. **`RowUF`** — for record row variables (`RVar of int`).
3. **`PolyVarUF`** — for leftover row variables in polymorphic variants (`leftover : int option`).

While they store different kinds of data (e.g. `ttype option` vs. `row option` vs. `poly_row option`), they follow the same fundamental pattern: 
- Each integer ID is associated with a node that either:
    - Directly stores partial information (i.e. the root), or
    - Points (links) to another node if it’s not ultimately the root.
- A `find` operation follows these links to reach the root and possibly applies path compression.
- A `union` operation makes one root link to the other root if they differ.

The differences are in *what* each root can store. For standard type variables, the module might store partial types. For record row variables, row data structures. For polymorphic variant leftover rows, partial `poly_row`s.  

---

## 2) `TypeUF` — Union-Find for Type Variables

### 2.1 Data Structure

```ocaml
module TypeUF = struct
    type node =
    | Link of int
    | Root of ttype option

    let store = Hashtbl.create (module Int)
    ...
end
```

- **`type node`**:
    - `Link of int`: This means “I’m not the root; I link to some other ID.”  
    - `Root of ttype option`: If `Root None`, the type variable is unconstrained. If `Root (Some t)`, it’s linked to a concrete partial type `t`.

- We store these nodes in a hash table called `store` indexed by integer IDs (the ID used in `TVar of int`).

### 2.2 `get_node x`

When we do “`get_node x`,” we look up ID `x` in `store`. If absent, we create a default node: `Root None`, meaning this variable is a fresh type variable with no constraints.

### 2.3 `find x`

This is the core function:

```ocaml
let rec find (x : int) : int * ttype option =
    match get_node x with
    | Link y ->
        let (r, topt) = find y in
        (* path compression *)
        if r <> y then Hashtbl.set store ~key:x ~data:(Link r);
        (r, topt)
    | Root t ->
        (x, t)
```

Process:

1. If the node is `Link y`, we recursively call `find y`. Eventually, we’ll get `(r, topt)` for the real root.  
2. **Path Compression**: We update `x` to point *directly* to `r` so subsequent finds are faster.  
3. If the node is `Root t`, it itself is the root. Return `(x, t)`.  

Hence, calling `find x` gives us both the *root ID* and optionally a partial type.  

#### Example of a Typical Scenario

Imagine we have 5 type variables: `0, 1, 2, 3, 4`. Suppose we unify 0 and 1, then unify 2 and 1, etc. Initially, none are in the table—on first usage, each gets `Root None`.

ASCII diagram (each ID → node content). Let’s say we unify 0 and 1:

```
Initially:
    0 (Root None)
    1 (Root None)
    2 (Root None)
    3 (Root None)
    4 (Root None)

After union(0,1):
    0 (Root None)
    1 (Link 0)          // means "1 is linked to 0"

    2 (Root None)
    3 (Root None)
    4 (Root None)
```

Now unify(2,1). In `find(1)`, we see `Link 0`. Then `find(0)` is `(0, None)`, so we unify 2’s root with 0:

```
    union(2,1):
    find(1) → root = 0
    find(2) → root = 2
    store: 
        0 (Root None)
        1 (Link 0)
        2 (Root None)
        3 (Root None)
        4 (Root None)

    union the roots (0,2). Suppose we link 2 -> 0:
        2 (Link 0)

Now:
    0 (Root None)
    1 (Link 0)
    2 (Link 0)
    3 (Root None)
    4 (Root None)
```

If we ever unify the variable 0 with a concrete type (e.g., `TInt`), we’d set `Root (Some TInt)` on 0’s root.

### 2.4 `union x y`

```ocaml
let union (x : int) (y : int) =
    let (rx, tx) = find x in
    let (ry, ty) = find y in
    if rx <> ry then (
    Hashtbl.set store ~key:ry ~data:(Link rx);
    match tx, ty with
    | None, None -> ()
    | None, Some t -> set_root_type rx (Some t)
    | Some t, None -> set_root_type rx (Some t)
    | Some _, Some _ -> ...
    )
```

- We find the roots `rx`, `ry` of `x` and `y`.  
- If `rx` ≠ `ry`, we link one root to the other. In the above snippet, we make `ry` link to `rx`.  
- If one root had `Some real_type` and the other had no type, we preserve that type in the new root. If both had some type, we either unify them further or do additional logic (like deeper merges).

---

## 3) `RowUF` — Union-Find for Record Row Variables

```ocaml
module RowUF = struct
    type row_node =
    | RLink of int
    | RRoot of row option

    let store = Hashtbl.create (module Int)
    ...
end
```

### 3.1 Similarities to `TypeUF`

- Instead of `Root of ttype option`, here we have `RRoot of row option`.  
- The logic is parallel: each ID in “row land” is either a link or a root with possible partial info (i.e., if we know the row is `RExtend(...)`, we might store that to unify with new constraints).

### 3.2 `find rv`

```ocaml
let rec find (rv : int) : int * row option =
    match get_node rv with
    | RLink r2 ->
        let (r, ropt) = find r2 in
        if r <> r2 then Hashtbl.set store ~key:rv ~data:(RLink r);
        (r, ropt)
    | RRoot ropt ->
        (rv, ropt)
```

- Same structure: if `RLink r2`, chase further; otherwise you’re at a root with optional row info.  

### 3.3 `union r1 r2`

```ocaml
let union (r1 : int) (r2 : int) =
    let (root1, ro1) = find r1 in
    let (root2, ro2) = find r2 in
    if root1 <> root2 then (
    Hashtbl.set store ~key:root2 ~data:(RLink root1);
    match ro1, ro2 with
    | None, None -> ()
    | None, Some r -> set_root root1 (Some r)
    | Some r, None -> set_root root1 (Some r)
    | Some _, Some _ -> ()
    )
```

Visually, if we unify two row variables 10 and 11:

```
    RowVar 10: RRoot None
    RowVar 11: RRoot (Some (RExtend("foo", TInt, ...)))
    -> unify(10, 11)
    => root(10) = 10, ro1= None
        root(11) = 11, ro2= Some (RExtend("foo", TInt, REmpty))
    => link 11 -> 10
    => set root(10) = Some (RExtend("foo", TInt, REmpty))

Now in store:
    10 -> RRoot (Some (RExtend("foo", TInt, REmpty)))
    11 -> RLink 10
```

---

## 4) `PolyVarUF` — Union-Find for Leftover Polymorphic Variant Rows

```ocaml
module PolyVarUF = struct
    type pv_node =
    | PVLink of int
    | PVRoot of poly_row option

    let store = Hashtbl.create (module Int)
    ...
end
```

### 4.1 Logic

Identical approach with different content: a `PVRoot (poly_row option)`. The remaining code in `find` and `union` is parallel to `TypeUF` and `RowUF`.  

### 4.2 Example

Suppose we have leftover IDs 21 (`Some [> ...]`) and 22 (`Some [> ...]`), then unify them. The logic merges their known tags or merges their “bound” states if, say, one is `AtMost` and the other is `AtLeast`.

---

## 5) Visual Overview of Union-Find Operations

### 5.1 Data Structure: Typical Diagram (For `TypeUF`)

```
    ID 0: Root (Some TInt)
    ID 1: Link 0
    ID 2: Link 0
    ID 3: Root None
    ID 4: Root (Some (TFun([TInt], TBool)))
```

We can think of it as:

```
    {0} <-- root with type = TInt
    ^
    1 - Link -> 0
    ^
    2 - Link -> 0

    {3} <-- root with type = None (unconstrained)
    {4} <-- root with type = Some (TFun([TInt], TBool))
```

### 5.2 Example Step-by-Step

#### Step 1: Initially no connections
```
    0: Root None
    1: Root None
    2: Root None
```

#### Step 2: unify(0,1)
- find(0) returns `(0, None)`  
- find(1) returns `(1, None)`  
- root0 ≠ root1, so we link 1 → 0. The new state:
```
    0: Root None
    1: Link 0
    2: Root None
```

#### Step 3: unify(2,1)
- find(1) → eventually `(0, None)`
- find(2) → `(2, None)`
- unify roots (0,2). Suppose we link 2 → 0. Now:
```
    0: Root None
    1: Link 0
    2: Link 0
```

#### Step 4: Suppose next we unify type variable 0 with `TInt`
- We do `TypeUF.set_root_type 0 (Some TInt)`. So:
```
    0: Root (Some TInt)
    1: Link 0
    2: Link 0
```
Now variables 0,1,2 effectively share the type `TInt`.

---

## 6) Why Three Separate Union-Find Structures?

Each union-find handles a specific domain of “IDs”:

1. `TypeUF` for normal type variables:
    - We might set or unify them with `TInt`, `TFun(...)`, etc.
    - Each root node can carry a `ttype option`.
    
2. `RowUF` for record row variables:
    - We unify them with actual row structures or with each other.
    - Each root node can store a `row option`.

3. `PolyVarUF` for leftover variant row variables:
    - We unify them with partial “polymorphic variant row” data.
    - Each root node can store a `poly_row option`.

They aren’t interchangeable: a row variable can’t unify with a normal type variable, so we keep them separate for clarity and correctness.

---

## 7) Summary of Benefits

- **Efficiency**: Union-find makes repeated unifications fast, and path compression ensures near-constant-time lookups.  
- **Simplicity**: The approach is structured: each “kind” of variable has its own union-find.  
- **Extensibility**: If you want to add new row-like structures or type categories, you could create new union-find modules with specialized data for their roots.

---

### Final Takeaway

The union-find modules (`TypeUF`, `RowUF`, `PolyVarUF`) in `chatml_typechecker.ml` are straightforward applications of the classic Disjoint Set Union approach, adapted to store partial typing information. By using these modules, the typechecker can unify types, record rows, and polymorphic variant rows consistently and efficiently, ensuring the entire system remains both flexible (open records, open variants) and performant.

## 1) The Purpose of `expand`
		
Whenever we infer or unify types, we store partial information in union-find structures. For example, if we unify a type variable `TVar(3)` with `TInt`, union-find might record that ID `3` points to a partial type or another variable. Over time, you can end up with chains like `TVar(3)` → `TVar(7)` → `TFloat`. Before we compare or finalize the type, we need to turn `TVar(3)` into `TFloat` by traversing and collapsing these links. This is precisely what `expand` does.

In short, **`expand` normalizes** a type by:
1. Following any union-find links to the final representative.  
2. Replacing that representative with its concrete “expanded” form if known.  
3. Recursively applying this process to sub-structures within a type (e.g., function arguments, record fields, variant tags).

---

## 2) The `expand` Function

```ocaml
let rec expand (ty : ttype) : ttype =
    match ty with
    | TVar tv ->
    let rid, maybe_ty = TypeUF.find tv in
    (match maybe_ty with
        | None -> TVar rid
        | Some real_ty ->
        let e = expand real_ty in
        TypeUF.set_root_type rid (Some e);
        e)
    | TFun (args, ret) -> TFun (List.map ~f:expand args, expand ret)
    | TRecord row -> TRecord (expand_row row)
    | TPolyVariant pv -> TPolyVariant (expand_poly_row pv)
    | TArray t -> TArray (expand t)
    | TModule fields ->
    let upd =
        List.map fields ~f:(fun (nm, Scheme (bvs, body)) -> nm, Scheme (bvs, expand body))
    in
    TModule upd
    | TInt | TBool | TFloat | TString | TUnit | TDynamic -> ty
```

Let’s break down each pattern match:

1. **`TVar tv`**:
    - We call `TypeUF.find tv` to obtain `(rid, maybe_ty)`.
        - `rid` is the canonical root ID for `tv` in the union-find structure.
        - `maybe_ty` is either `None` (no known concrete type yet) or `Some real_ty` (a partially known or fully known type).
    - If `maybe_ty` is `None`, we haven’t found a concrete type, so we return `TVar rid`. That means “this type variable is still an open/unconstrained variable, but we keep it at the representative ID `rid`.”
    - If `maybe_ty` is `Some real_ty`, we recursively `expand real_ty`. This step ensures, for instance, if `real_ty` itself contains further type variables, we keep collapsing them as well.
    - After we get the final expanded `e`, we do `TypeUF.set_root_type rid (Some e)` to store the newly collapsed form in the union-find structure (so future lookups become simpler).
    - Finally, we return `e`.

    **Conceptually**:
    ```
    TVar(3)  --(find)-->  root = 7, Some TFloat
    expand TFloat => TFloat
    Overwrite root(7) with TFloat
    return TFloat
    ```

2. **`TFun (args, ret)`**:
    - We recursively expand each type in the argument list `args`.
    - We recursively expand the return type `ret`.
    - We rebuild the function type `TFun (expanded_args, expanded_ret)`.
    - This case ensures we propagate expansion into function subtypes.

3. **`TRecord row`**:
    - We pass the row into `expand_row row`, a helper function specifically for record rows.
    - The result is wrapped back into `TRecord (...)`.

4. **`TPolyVariant pv`**:
    - We call `expand_poly_row pv`, another helper that specifically expands polymorphic variants (including leftover row IDs).
    - The expanded structure becomes `TPolyVariant (some_new_poly_row)`.

5. **`TArray t`**:
    - Arrays have an element type `t`. We expand `t` recursively.

6. **`TModule fields`**:
    - A module’s “type” is stored as `(string * scheme) list`. For each `(nm, Scheme (bvs, body))`, we expand `body` recursively. The bound variables `bvs` remain as-is, but the body might get further collapsed.

7. **Primitives (`TInt`, `TBool`, etc.)**:
    - Nothing to expand; we return them as-is.

---

## 3) The `expand_row` Function

```ocaml
and expand_row (r : row) : row =
    match r with
    | REmpty -> REmpty
    | RExtend (lbl, fty, tail) -> RExtend (lbl, expand fty, expand_row tail)
    | RVar rv ->
    let root, ropt = RowUF.find rv in
    (match ropt with
        | None -> RVar root
        | Some actual ->
        let e = expand_row actual in
        RowUF.set_root root (Some e);
        e)
```

A record row `row` can be one of:
1. `REmpty`: A closed empty record — trivially expanded to `REmpty`.
2. `RExtend (lbl, fty, tail)`: We expand the field type `fty` with `expand fty`, and recurse into its `tail` with `expand_row tail`. We rebuild `RExtend (...)` from those expansions.
3. `RVar rv`: This is the “row variable.” It might link in union-find to another row or be unconstrained. So:
    - We do `RowUF.find rv`, which returns `(root, ropt)`.  
    - If `ropt = None`, we simply say `RVar root`, meaning it’s still open.  
    - If `ropt = Some actual`, that means we have more specific row data stored. So we recursively call `expand_row actual` to further collapse any substructure. Then we update the root with this newly collapsed row. Finally, we return that collapsed row.

Visually:
```
RVar(10)  --(RowUF.find 10)--> root=12, ropt= Some (RExtend("x", TVar(4), REmpty))

expand_row (RExtend("x", TVar(4), REmpty))
    => RExtend("x", <expansion of TVar(4)>, REmpty)
        Suppose TVar(4) -> TBool after expansion

Now we store RowUF.set_root 12 (Some (RExtend("x", TBool, REmpty)))
Return RExtend("x", TBool, REmpty)
```

---

## 4) Expanding Polymorphic Variants: `expand_poly_row`

The polymorphic variant logic is a bit more involved, so the code is split into two functions:

- `expand_poly_row pv` (entry point)  
- `expand_poly_row_with visited_pvs pv` (actual recursive logic)

### 4.1 `expand_poly_row`

```ocaml
and expand_poly_row (pv : poly_row) : poly_row =
    let visited_pvs = Int.Hash_set.create () in
    expand_poly_row_with visited_pvs pv
```

This function initializes a `visited_pvs` set of leftover IDs to avoid infinite recursion if a leftover references itself or cycles. It then delegates to `expand_poly_row_with`.

### 4.2 `expand_poly_row_with visited_pvs pv`

```ocaml
and expand_poly_row_with (visited_pvs : Int.Hash_set.t) (pv : poly_row) : poly_row =
    let expanded_tags =
    List.map pv.tags ~f:(fun (tag, tys) -> tag, List.map tys ~f:expand)
    in
    let bound = pv.bound in
    match pv.leftover with
    | None ->
    { bound; tags = expanded_tags; leftover = None }
    | Some leftover_id ->
    if Hash_set.mem visited_pvs leftover_id
    then
        (* Already visited, avoid re-expanding to prevent cycles. *)
        { bound; tags = expanded_tags; leftover = Some leftover_id }
    else (
        Hash_set.add visited_pvs leftover_id;
        let root, ropt = PolyVarUF.find leftover_id in
        match ropt with
        | None ->
        (* No known leftover shape yet, so just keep leftover = Some root. *)
        { bound; tags = expanded_tags; leftover = Some root }

        | Some leftover_row ->
        (* Expand that leftover row. *)
        let expanded_leftover_row = expand_poly_row_with visited_pvs leftover_row in
        (* Possibly unify or merge the tags/bounds if needed. *)
        let merged_bound = unify_poly_bounds bound expanded_leftover_row.bound in
        let merged_tags =
            unify_poly_tags
            bound
            expanded_leftover_row.bound
            expanded_tags
            expanded_leftover_row.tags
        in
        {
            bound = merged_bound;
            tags = merged_tags;
            leftover = expanded_leftover_row.leftover;
        }
    )
```

Step-by-step:

1. **Expand Tag Arguments**: First, we map over `pv.tags`. Each tag has a list of argument types; we call `expand` on each argument type to collapse any variables.

2. **Check `pv.leftover`**:
    - If `None`, we have a “closed” set of tags (or exactly a known set, if `pv.bound` is `Exact`). We simply return `{ bound; tags = expanded_tags; leftover = None }`.
    - If `Some leftover_id`, that means we have an open poly variant that could unify with more tags. We must see if we’ve visited it before (to prevent infinite recursion).
        - If we’ve visited it, we can skip further expansion (or keep the same leftover).
        - Otherwise, we do `PolyVarUF.find leftover_id` → `(root, ropt)`.
        - If `ropt = None`, that means we haven’t got a more specific leftover row. So we keep `leftover = Some root`.
        - If `ropt = Some leftover_row`, then we recursively expand `leftover_row` as well. After we have that, we may unify bounds and unify tags (via `unify_poly_bounds` and `unify_poly_tags`). This merges the knowledge from our current row with the knowledge in the leftover row. We store the final shape in this function’s result.

#### Example Visualization

```
We have a variant row: [> `X(int) ]
and leftover is 5 in union-find.

We look up leftover 5 -> found a partial row [< `Y(string) ] leftover=?
We expand them together. 
We unify bounds > and < -> that typically yields exact or some merged bounding. 
We unify tags X(int) with Y(string) (they are distinct tags, so we keep both).
Result might be something like [ `X(int) | `Y(string) ] leftover=some_new_id
```

---

## 5) Putting It All Together

Whenever the typechecker needs to compare or store a type in the environment (or unify it further), it runs `expand` (or the relevant row/variant expansions) to ensure we’re dealing in a canonical, simplified form.

- **`expand`** collapses standard type variables.  
- **`expand_row`** does the same for record rows.  
- **`expand_poly_row`** handles open/closed polymorphic variants.  

In all these cases, we:
1. **Follow union-find** to find if the variable is linked to something more concrete.  
2. **Recursively apply** expansion to subparts.  
3. **Update** union-find so that future lookups become direct (path compression, but applied in a type-level sense).

Thus, after repeated expansions, a type that started as something like:

```
TFun([TVar(3), TVar(7)], TBool)
where TVar(3) -> unify with TInt
and    TVar(7) -> unify with TArray(TVar(9))...
```
might eventually become:

```
TFun([TInt, TArray(TVar(9))], TBool)
```
(and if `TVar(9)` further collapses to `TFloat`, it becomes `TFun([TInt, TArray(TFloat)], TBool)`).

---

## 6) Summary of Key Points

1. **`expand`** is the main entry to ensure types are in their canonical forms.  
2. Each branch (`TVar`, `TFun`, etc.) either directly returns the original type if it’s fully concrete (like `TInt`) or recurses deeper into union-find links or substructures.  
3. **Rows** and **polymorphic variants** have specialized helpers because they track partial information in separate union-find stores (`RowUF`, `PolyVarUF`) and need specialized expansions.  
4. Repeated calls to `expand` gradually simplify the internal structures, so that the typechecker can effectively unify, compare, and reason about types without being bogged down in multiple layers of indirection.

By following these steps and recognizing the role of union-find beneath the scenes, you can see how each match case “transforms” the type from a possibly complex or partially known form into a more stable final representation.

## 1) Purpose of `unify`
		
In type inference, **unification** enforces that two types must be identical. For instance, if we have `x + 1`, we unify the type of `x` with `TInt` to require `x` be an integer. Or if `f` is applied to two arguments, we unify `f`'s type with a function type of the correct arity.

The primary function:

```ocaml
let rec unify (t1 : ttype) (t2 : ttype) : unit = ...
```

1. *Normalizes* both `t1` and `t2` using `expand t1`, `expand t2`. This collapses each type’s union-find references so we can compare their “real” forms.
2. *Pattern matches* on the resulting form of `t1` and `t2`.
3. If they are definitely incompatible, throws `Type_error`.
4. If they match on structure (e.g. both are `TFun(...)`, or both are `TRecord ...`), recursively unify their subparts (function argument types, record fields, variant tags, etc.).
5. If one is a `TVar` or open row or open variant leftover, we link them in the union-find structure or unify them with the other side’s known type.

---

## 2) The `unify` Function Body

Below is the core:

```ocaml
and unify (t1 : ttype) (t2 : ttype) : unit =
    let t1' = expand t1 in
    let t2' = expand t2 in
    match t1', t2' with
    | TDynamic, _ -> ()
    | _, TDynamic -> ()
    
    | TInt, TInt
    | TBool, TBool
    | TFloat, TFloat
    | TString, TString
    | TUnit, TUnit ->
    ()

    | TVar x, TVar y ->
    TypeUF.union x y

    | TVar x, other ->
    TypeUF.set_root_type x (Some other)

    | other, TVar x ->
    TypeUF.set_root_type x (Some other)

    | TFun (a1, r1), TFun (a2, r2) ->
    if List.length a1 <> List.length a2 then
        raise (Type_error "Function arity mismatch");
    List.iter2_exn a1 a2 ~f:unify;
    unify r1 r2

    | TRecord ra, TRecord rb ->
    unify_rows ra rb

    | TPolyVariant pvA, TPolyVariant pvB ->
    unify_poly_variant_rows pvA pvB

    | TArray e1, TArray e2 ->
    unify e1 e2

    | TModule _, TModule _ ->
    raise (Type_error "Unifying modules directly is not supported in this example.")

    | TModule _, _
    | _, TModule _ ->
    raise (Type_error "Cannot unify a module with a non-module.")

    | _ ->
    let msg = Printf.sprintf "Cannot unify %s with %s" (show_type t1') (show_type t2') in
    raise (Type_error msg)
```

Let’s break down each case:

1. **`TDynamic`**  
    - If either side is `TDynamic`, it unifies trivially with the other. This means “dynamic” is treated as a universal catch-all type. 
    ```ocaml
    | TDynamic, _ -> ()
    | _, TDynamic -> ()
    ```
    No further unification is needed; we allow them to match automatically.

2. **Same Primitive Type**  
    - If both are `TInt`, or both are `TBool`, etc., then no further work is needed:
    ```ocaml
    | TInt, TInt
    | TBool, TBool
    | TFloat, TFloat
    | TString, TString
    | TUnit, TUnit -> ()
    ```
    This basically says “`int` unifies with `int`, `bool` with `bool`, etc.”

3. **Both are Type Variables**  
    ```ocaml
    | TVar x, TVar y -> TypeUF.union x y
    ```
    - If `TVar x` and `TVar y` are two unknown type variables, we unify them in the union-find structure for type variables (`TypeUF`). This indicates they represent the same unknown type.

4. **`TVar x` vs. a Concrete/Structured Type**  
    ```ocaml
    | TVar x, other -> TypeUF.set_root_type x (Some other)
    | other, TVar x -> TypeUF.set_root_type x (Some other)
    ```
    - If one side is a type variable `TVar x` and the other is, say, `TInt`, `TFun(...)`, or some other type, we record in the union-find that `x` is now that “other” type. 
    - Future expansions of `TVar x` will see that it’s a root with `Some other` in the union-find store.

5. **Function Types**  
    ```ocaml
    | TFun (a1, r1), TFun (a2, r2) ->
        if List.length a1 <> List.length a2 then
        raise (Type_error "Function arity mismatch");
        List.iter2_exn a1 a2 ~f:unify;
        unify r1 r2
    ```
    - Both sides are functions of the same arity. We unify each pair of argument types (e.g. the first argument with the first argument, second with second, etc.), then unify the return types. 
    - If their arities differ, we immediately error out.

6. **Record Types**  
    ```ocaml
    | TRecord ra, TRecord rb ->
        unify_rows ra rb
    ```
    - We delegate to a helper function `unify_rows`, which merges or checks the two row structures. More on this below.

7. **Polymorphic Variants**  
    ```ocaml
    | TPolyVariant pvA, TPolyVariant pvB ->
        unify_poly_variant_rows pvA pvB
    ```
    - Another helper function `unify_poly_variant_rows` merges sets of tags, leftover row variables, etc.

8. **Arrays**  
    ```ocaml
    | TArray e1, TArray e2 ->
        unify e1 e2
    ```
    - If both sides are arrays, we unify their element types `e1`, `e2`. 
    - If the element types unify successfully, the arrays are considered compatible.

9. **Modules**  
    ```ocaml
    | TModule _, TModule _ ->
        raise (Type_error "Unifying modules directly is not supported in this example.")

    | TModule _, _
    | _, TModule _ ->
        raise (Type_error "Cannot unify a module with a non-module.")
    ```
    - In this approach, unifying modules is not supported or is ill-defined. The code explicitly rejects attempts to unify a module with anything.

10. **Catch-All**  
    ```ocaml
    | _ ->
        let msg = ...
        raise (Type_error msg)
    ```
    - If none of the above match, we fail with a `Type_error` stating the mismatch between expanded types (e.g. `TFun(...)` vs. `TInt`).

---

## 3) `unify_rows` for Record Types

When we unify two records, `ra` and `rb`, the function:

```ocaml
and unify_rows (ra : row) (rb : row) : unit = ...
```

1. Converts each row to a map of labels to types plus an optional leftover row variable (if the record is open). This is done in `row_to_map`.
2. We unify field by field. If a label exists in both, unify the corresponding types. If it exists only in one, check if the other record is open. If open, we can add that field; if closed, error out.
3. If both have leftover row variables, we unify them in `RowUF.union`.
4. We build a final row structure that merges all discovered fields and leftover references, then store it in the union-find so future expansions see the merged shape.

---

## 4) `unify_poly_variant_rows` for Polymorphic Variants

Polymorphic variants need special logic for merging sets of tags:

```ocaml
and unify_poly_variant_rows (pvA : poly_row) (pvB : poly_row) : unit = ...
```

Steps:
1. Expand both `pvA` and `pvB`.
2. Combine or unify the bounds (`AtLeast`, `AtMost`, `Exact`).
3. Merge/union each tag that appears in both. If a tag is in both sets, unify their argument types. If it’s in only one set but the other side is `AtMost`, that might raise an error (tag not allowed).
4. If both sides have leftover row variables, unify them in `PolyVarUF.union`.
5. Store the final shape of the merged variant row back into union-find.

---

## 5) Putting It All Together

The unification process is crucial to type inference: each time we realize two types have to be the same, we call `unify t1 t2`, and the system merges them. Later expansions will see them as the same type. This is how we solve constraints produced by function application, condition checks, pattern-matching, etc.

### Example: Unifying a Function Type

Imagine the typechecker sees `f x` where `f : TFun([TVar 0], TVar 1)` and `x : TInt`. Then:

1. `unify (TFun([TVar 0], TVar 1)) (TFun([TInt], TVar 2))`  
2. We unify argument lists: unify `TVar 0` with `TInt`. That sets `TVar 0 → TInt`.  
3. Then unify return types: unify `TVar 1` with `TVar 2`. This merges them so anywhere we see `TVar 1` or `TVar 2`, it’s the same variable.  
4. Future expansions might discover more constraints, eventually giving `TVar 1 (and 2)` a final type like `TBool`.

### Example: Unifying Two Record Types

```
    Record #1: { name: string; age: int; ... rvar5 }
    Record #2: { age: int; ... rvar7 }
```
- We unify the field types for `age`, see `int` vs. `int`, that’s fine.
- For `name: string` in the first record but not the second:
    - If the second record is open (a leftover row var rvar7), we can incorporate `name: string`.
    - If the second record is closed, it’s a type error.
- We unify leftover row variables rvar5 and rvar7 if both sides are open. Then both records become a single merged row in the union-find.

---

## 6) Conclusion

- The **`unify`** function is the core routine ensuring that whenever the type system demands two types must match, we systematically merge them using union-find logic, recursive expansion, and specialized unification for records and polymorphic variants.
- Handling these match branches carefully is essential for correctness: each type combination (or mismatch) is accounted for.  
- Combined with repeated calls to `expand`, unification leads to a consistent, “collapse to normal form” effect, meaning all references to `TVar(...)` or row variables eventually line up.

Ultimately, by checking these cases and applying the correct merges or errors, **`unify`** is what ties together the flexible type variables, row variables, and variant leftover IDs into a coherent, well-typed system or fails fast with a descriptive `Type_error` when no valid unification is possible.

Below is a deeper walkthrough of the **`unify_rows`** and **`unify_poly_variant_rows`** functions, which handle unification for **record rows** and **polymorphic variant rows**, respectively. These are specialized subroutines invoked by the main `unify` function whenever encountering `TRecord` or `TPolyVariant` types.
		
---

## 1) Unifying Record Rows: `unify_rows`

Records in this DSL are represented as a “row” data structure:

```ocaml
type row =
    | REmpty
    | RExtend of string * ttype * row
    | RVar of int
```

- **`REmpty`**: closed, empty record `{}`.
- **`RExtend (lbl, fty, tail)`**: a record with a field `"lbl"` of type `fty`, plus the rest of the row `tail`.
- **`RVar of int`**: an “open” row variable, which may unify with more fields or other open row variables.

### 1.1 The `unify_rows` Function

```ocaml
and unify_rows (ra : row) (rb : row) : unit =
    let mapA, leftoverA = row_to_map ra in
    let mapB, leftoverB = row_to_map rb in
    let all_keys =
    Set.union
        (Set.of_list (module String) (Map.keys mapA))
        (Set.of_list (module String) (Map.keys mapB))
    in
    let merged_fields = ref String.Map.empty in
    
    Set.iter all_keys ~f:(fun lbl ->
    let tA_opt = Map.find mapA lbl in
    let tB_opt = Map.find mapB lbl in
    match tA_opt, tB_opt with
    | Some tyA, Some tyB ->
        (* If the label appears in both records, unify their types. *)
        unify tyA tyB;
        merged_fields := Map.set !merged_fields ~key:lbl ~data:(expand tyA)

    | Some tyA, None ->
        (* The label is present in A but missing in B. *)
        (match leftoverB with
        | Some _ ->
            (* If B is open, we can “add” this field to B. *)
            merged_fields := Map.set !merged_fields ~key:lbl ~data:(expand tyA)
        | None ->
            (* If B is closed, that’s a type error. *)
            raise (Type_error
            (Printf.sprintf "Extra field '%s' not allowed; record is closed on RHS." lbl)))

    | None, Some tyB ->
        (* The label is present in B but missing in A. *)
        (match leftoverA with
        | Some _ ->
            merged_fields := Map.set !merged_fields ~key:lbl ~data:(expand tyB)
        | None ->
            raise (Type_error
            (Printf.sprintf "Missing field '%s' not present in record on LHS." lbl)))

    | None, None -> ());

    (* Now unify leftover row variables, if both are open. *)
    let final_leftover =
    match leftoverA, leftoverB with
    | None, None -> None
    | Some rvA, None -> Some rvA
    | None, Some rvB -> Some rvB
    | Some rvA, Some rvB ->
        RowUF.union rvA rvB;
        let root, _ = RowUF.find rvA in
        Some root
    in
    
    let final_row = row_of_map !merged_fields final_leftover in

    (* Store 'final_row' in both ra and rb union-find links, ensuring expansions see the updated shape. *)
    let store_final (r : row) =
    match expand_row r with
    | RVar rv ->
        let root, _ = RowUF.find rv in
        RowUF.set_root root (Some final_row)
    | _ -> ()
    in
    store_final ra;
    store_final rb
```

**Detailed Steps**:

1. **Convert each row to a map**:
    - `row_to_map` yields `(String.Map<t>, leftover_rvar_option)`.  
        - For example, `RExtend("x", TInt, RExtend("y", TBool, REmpty))` might become a map `{ "x" -> TInt; "y" -> TBool }` and `None` leftover if it’s closed.  
        - If it’s `RExtend("z", TFloat, RVar 7)`, it might produce a map `{ "z" -> TFloat }` plus leftover row var = `Some 7`.

2. **Collect all field labels** that appear in either record into `all_keys`.

3. **Iterate** over each label:
    - If the label is in both maps, we unify their field types: `unify tyA tyB`.
    - If it’s only in one map, we check whether the other record is open (leftover row var). If open, we add that field to the merged map. If not open, it’s an error.

4. **Unify leftover row variables**:
    - If both sides have leftover row variables (e.g., `RVar a`, `RVar b`), we do `RowUF.union a b` so they become the same open tail.
    - If only one side is open, that open variable remains in the final leftover.
    - If neither is open, final leftover is `None`.

5. **Build a final row** with `row_of_map merged_fields final_leftover`, which re-constructs a row type from the map plus leftover.

6. **Store** the final merged row back into each side’s union-find structure. That ensures that expansions of either record row see the new, unified result next time.


### 1.2 Visualization Example

Imagine:

```
Left record (ra):
    RExtend("x", TInt, RExtend("y", TBool, RVar(10)))

Right record (rb):
    RExtend("y", TBool, RExtend("z", TFloat, REmpty))
```

- `row_to_map ra` → ( {"x" -> TInt, "y" -> TBool}, leftoverA=Some 10 )  
- `row_to_map rb` → ( {"y" -> TBool, "z" -> TFloat}, leftoverB=None )  

Field-by-field:

- label `"x"`: in mapA only. leftoverB = None → error if we can’t add it. But leftoverB is actually `None`, so we raise a type error: “Extra field `x` not allowed.”  
    - If `rb` were open (say leftoverB=Some 11), we’d insert `"x" -> TInt` into the merged map, meaning both now share that field.  

Hence, if both sides were open, we’d unify them and produce a record containing `x:int, y:bool, z:float, leftover=someVar`.

---

## 2) Unifying Polymorphic Variant Rows: `unify_poly_variant_rows`

Polymorphic variants can be “open” or constrained by “bounds” (`Exact`, `AtLeast`, `AtMost`). We also have leftover row variables in union-find for variants. For example:

```ocaml
type poly_row_bound =
    | Exact
    | AtLeast
    | AtMost

type poly_row = {
    bound : poly_row_bound;
    tags : (string * ttype list) list;  (* Tag name plus argument types *)
    leftover : int option;             (* optional leftover var in PolyVarUF *)
}
```

### 2.1 The `unify_poly_variant_rows` Function

```ocaml
and unify_poly_variant_rows (pvA : poly_row) (pvB : poly_row) : unit =
    let eA = expand_poly_row pvA in
    let eB = expand_poly_row pvB in
    let final_bound = unify_poly_bounds eA.bound eB.bound in
    let merged_tags = unify_poly_tags eA.bound eB.bound eA.tags eB.tags in

    (* unify leftover row variables if both sides are open. *)
    let leftover =
    match eA.leftover, eB.leftover with
    | None, None -> None
    | Some la, None -> Some la
    | None, Some lb -> Some lb
    | Some la, Some lb ->
        PolyVarUF.union la lb;
        let root, _ropt = PolyVarUF.find la in
        Some root
    in

    (* Now we have a final shape: combine final_bound, merged_tags, leftover. *)
    let final_poly = { bound = final_bound; tags = merged_tags; leftover } in

    (* If leftover is Some, store final_poly in that leftover's union-find. *)
    let store_in lf =
    let _, ropt = PolyVarUF.find lf in
    match ropt with
    | None -> PolyVarUF.set_root lf (Some final_poly)
    | Some _old -> PolyVarUF.set_root lf (Some final_poly)
    in
    (match leftover with
    | Some lf -> store_in lf
    | None -> ());
    ()
```

**Detailed Steps**:

1. **Expand Both**: 
    - We call `expand_poly_row` on `pvA` and `pvB`. This collapses any leftover references or partial data inside them, so we get the most up-to-date shape.

2. **Unify Bounds**: 
    - `final_bound = unify_poly_bounds eA.bound eB.bound` merges the bound constraints. For instance:
        - `Exact` + `AtMost` might yield `AtMost`, or in some logic, `AtLeast` + `AtMost` might become `Exact`.  
        - There’s some domain-specific logic about how to handle merging these constraints.

3. **Merge Tags**: 
    - `merged_tags = unify_poly_tags eA.bound eB.bound eA.tags eB.tags`. This function:  
        - Checks each tag in both sets. If a tag is present on both sides, it iterates over the argument types to unify them. E.g. if `tag` has `int * float` on one side and `int * float` on the other, that’s fine. If they differ in length or type, we raise an error.  
        - If a tag appears in only one side, but the other side’s bound is `AtMost`, that might be a type error because that side doesn’t allow additional tags.

4. **Unify Leftover**:
    - If both sides have leftover IDs, unify them via `PolyVarUF.union`. Then, after union, we note the final leftover is the union’s root.  
    - If only one side has a leftover, that leftover is carried forward. If neither does, leftover is `None`.

5. **Store Final**:
    - We build `final_poly = { bound = final_bound; tags = merged_tags; leftover }`.  
    - If we have a leftover id, we store `Some final_poly` in that leftover’s union-find node, so subsequent expansions see the newly merged tags/bound.

### 2.2 Visual Example

Suppose:

```
pvA = [> `Foo(int) ; leftover=Some 10 ]
pvB = [< `Bar(float) ; leftover=Some 11 ]
```

- `AtLeast` (`>`): pvA must contain `Foo` but can have more.  
- `AtMost` (`<`): pvB can contain `Bar` but can’t add unknown tags.  

1. **Expand**: if each leftover references partial data, they get merged.  
2. **Bounds**: merging `AtLeast` and `AtMost` might yield `Exact` in a simplistic approach or might remain in a partial state for more advanced systems.  
3. **Tags**: tag sets are `Foos(...)` from A, `Bars(...)` from B.  
    - If one side’s bound is `AtMost`, we can’t add new tags beyond those known on the other side. If we choose “Exact” as the outcome, we might unify them to `[ `Foo(int) | `Bar(float) ]` if that’s permissible.  
4. **Leftover**: unify leftover 10 and 11 — `PolyVarUF.union(10,11)`.  
    - We store the final shape `[ `Foo(int) | `Bar(float) ; leftover=someRoot ]` or error if constraints can’t be satisfied.

---

## 3) Summary

- **`unify_rows`** solves how to merge two record row types, either adding or unifying fields, checking open vs. closed row tails.
- **`unify_poly_variant_rows`** merges the sets of tags, deals with leftover open variant row variables, and systematically updates the union-find so expansions will see the final form.

Both are crucial subroutines in handling advanced ML-style features of **row types** and **polymorphic variants**:  
- They rely on union-find for partial, open structures (record row variables, leftover variant row variables).  
- They gather relevant fields/tags, unify them pairwise, and unify any leftover row variables.  
- They carefully accommodate “open” expansions (`RVar`, leftover IDs) and handle constraints (`AtMost`, `AtLeast`, etc.).

As a result, these functions are what enable flexible, composable record/variant types in this DSL while retaining strong type safety (or producing meaningful errors if unification is impossible).

---

Below is a more extensive explanation of Section 9 in `chatml_typechecker.ml`, focusing on *free type variables*, *schemes*, *instantiation*, and *generalization*. These concepts address let-polymorphism by controlling how type variables become generalized or specialized within the environment. Essentially, these functions determine which type variables remain free (potentially reusable across contexts) and which are bound by a particular definition.
		
---

## 1) Free Type Variables

In a polymorphic type system, we frequently need to gather all **unconstrained** (or “free”) type variables in a type. This is handled by:

### 1.1 `free_tvars ty` 

```ocaml
let rec free_tvars (ty : ttype) : Int.Set.t =
    match expand ty with
    | TInt | TBool | TFloat | TString | TUnit | TDynamic -> Int.Set.empty
    | TVar i -> Int.Set.singleton i
    | TFun (args, ret) ->
    let sets = List.map args ~f:free_tvars in
    let s = Set.union_list (module Int) sets in
    Set.union s (free_tvars ret)
    | TArray t -> free_tvars t
    | TPolyVariant pv -> ...
    | TRecord r -> ...
    | TModule fields -> ...
```

Here is how the pattern match works:

1. **Primitive Types** `(TInt, TBool, TFloat, TString, TUnit, TDynamic)`:
    - These contain no type variables, so the result is an empty set.

2. **`TVar i`**:
    - A direct type variable. We return a singleton set containing `i`.

3. **`TFun (args, ret)`**:
    - For a function type, we union the free variables of each argument in `args` and unify that union with the free variables of `ret`.

4. **`TArray t`**:
    - Arrays hold a single element type `t`; we gather free vars from `t`.

5. **`TPolyVariant pv`**:
    - For a polymorphic variant, we examine all tags. Each tag has a list of argument types; we union together the free variables of each argument.

6. **`TRecord r`**:
    - We use a helper function `free_row_tvars` for record rows.

7. **`TModule fields`**:
    - A module type is stored as a list of `(string, scheme)` pairs. We collect all free variables of each scheme’s body.

#### 1.2 `free_row_tvars r`
```ocaml
and free_row_tvars (r : row) =
    match expand_row r with
    | REmpty -> Int.Set.empty
    | RExtend (_, fty, tail) ->
    Set.union (free_tvars fty) (free_row_tvars tail)
    | RVar _ -> Int.Set.empty
```
Records split into:
- **`REmpty`**: no fields, no type variables.  
- **`RExtend (lbl, fty, tail)`**: union the free vars of `fty` with the free vars of the `tail` row.  
- **`RVar _`**: row variables in this design do not directly appear in the environment as normal type variables. So we return an empty set here. (These row variables are handled by a separate union-find logic and typically are not generalized the same way as normal type variables.)

---

## 2) Gathering Free Type Variables in Schemes and Environments

### 2.1 `free_tvars_scheme (Scheme (bvs, body))`
```ocaml
let free_tvars_scheme (Scheme (bvs, body)) =
    let fv_body = free_tvars body in
    Set.diff fv_body (Int.Set.of_list bvs)
```
- A *scheme* is typically `(Scheme (bound_vars, body_type))`. Bound variables `bvs` are universally quantified in that scheme, so they are *not* considered free *outside* the scheme.  
- The function first computes all free type variables in `body_type`. Then it removes any that appear in the scheme’s bound list `bvs`.

### 2.2 `free_tvars_env env`
```ocaml
let free_tvars_env (env : (string, scheme) Hashtbl.t) : Int.Set.t =
    Hashtbl.data env
    |> List.map ~f:free_tvars_scheme
    |> Set.union_list (module Int)
```
- We map each value in the environment (which is a `scheme`) to its free type variables (excluding its bound ones).  
- Then we union all of those sets into one set.  
- This gives us all free type variables that are still *live* in the environment.

---

## 3) Generalization

When we write `let x = expr in ...` in an ML-like language, we want `x` to be polymorphic in the type variables that do **not** appear free in the environment. This process is called **generalization**. That is:

```ocaml
let generalize (env : (string, scheme) Hashtbl.t) (ty : ttype) : scheme =
    let fv_env = free_tvars_env env in
    let fv_ty = free_tvars ty in
    let gen_vars = Set.diff fv_ty fv_env in
    Scheme (Set.to_list gen_vars, ty)
```

**Explanation**:
1. **`fv_env`**: all free type variables in the existing environment. If a type variable is free in the environment, we _cannot_ generalize it (it belongs to a broader scope that must remain the same).
2. **`fv_ty`**: all free type variables in the type of `expr`.
3. **`gen_vars`** = `fv_ty - fv_env`: the set of type variables that appear free in `ty` but *not* in the environment. These can be universally quantified because they’re specific to this definition, not used by anything else outside.
4. Finally, we produce `Scheme (ListOf gen_vars, ty)`. This scheme says “the type is `ty`, universally quantified over `gen_vars`.”

For example, if `ty` is `TFun([TVar 0], TVar 1)`, but `TVar 1` is free in the environment while `TVar 0` is not, we only generalize `TVar 0`. So the result might be `Scheme ([0], TFun([TVar 0], TVar 1))`.

---

## 4) Instantiation

After a polymorphic binding is stored as a `scheme`, each time we refer to it, we must *instantiate* a fresh copy of its bound variables so different uses of the same function can have different specialized types.

### 4.1 `instantiate (Scheme (bvars, body))`
```ocaml
let rec instantiate (Scheme (bvars, body)) : ttype =
    let mapping = Int.Table.create () in
    List.iter bvars ~f:(fun bv ->
    Hashtbl.set mapping ~key:bv ~data:(fresh_tvar ()));
    
    let rec repl ty =
    match expand ty with
    | TInt | TBool | TFloat | TString | TUnit | TDynamic -> ty
    | TVar tv ->
        (match Hashtbl.find mapping tv with
        | Some nty -> nty
        | None -> TVar tv)
    | TFun (a, r) -> TFun (List.map a ~f:repl, repl r)
    | TArray el -> TArray (repl el)
    | TRecord row -> TRecord (repl_row row)
    | TPolyVariant pv -> ...
    | TModule fs -> ...
    and repl_row r = ...
    in
    repl body
```

**Detailed Steps**:
1. We create a `mapping` from “old type var” → “new type var.”  
2. For each bound variable in `bvars`, we produce a new fresh type variable (`fresh_tvar ()`), storing `(bv -> that new var)` in the `mapping`.  
3. We define an inner function `repl ty`:
    - We always `expand ty` to chase any union-find links.  
    - If it’s a primitive (`TInt`, `TBool`, etc.), return it as is.  
    - If it’s `TVar tv`, we look up `tv` in `mapping`. If present, replace it with the newly generated type variable. Otherwise, keep it as `TVar tv` (i.e., `tv` is not bound by this scheme).  
    - For function types, arrays, records, polymorphic variants, or modules, we recursively call `repl` on sub-parts to ensure consistent renaming.
4. Finally, we apply `repl` to the scheme’s `body`. That yields a version of `body` with each of the scheme’s bound variables replaced by fresh ones.

Hence if a function in the environment has a scheme `(Scheme ([0], TFun([TVar 0], TVar 0)))`, each use of that function will produce a new type like `TFun([TVar 37], TVar 37])`, meaning the function is generic in that type variable.

---

## 5) Putting It All Together

1. **`free_tvars`** and its row/variant subroutines compute which type variables occur free in a given type.  
2. **`free_tvars_scheme`, `free_tvars_env`** extend this logic to handle entire schemes and the environment, accounting for which variables are bound vs. free.  
3. **`generalize env ty`** determines which type variables in `ty` can be made universally quantified, creating a scheme.  
4. **`instantiate scheme`** applies a fresh substitution to those bound variables so each usage is independent.

These functions enable classic Hindley–Milner–style polymorphism: a definition is type-inferred, then *generalized* at the binding site, and every time you reference that definition, we *instantiate* a fresh copy of its type to allow different specialized instantiations in different contexts. This is a key part of building a practical ML-like language with robust static typing and polymorphism.

---

Below is a comprehensive explanation of **Section 10** from `chatml_typechecker.ml`, where the *expression* and *pattern* inference logic is defined. These functions, `infer_expr` and `infer_pattern`, are at the heart of the type inference process. Each AST node in your DSL is matched and assigned a type, with unification ensuring consistency across the program.

### 1.1 Explanation of Main Cases

1. **Literals**:  
    ```ocaml
    | EInt _ -> TInt
    | EBool _ -> TBool
    | EFloat _ -> TFloat
    | EString _ -> TString
    ```
    Each literal directly corresponds to a primitive type.

2. **Variables** (`EVar x`):  
    ```ocaml
    | EVar x -> lookup_env env x
    ```
    We retrieve the type (technically, a scheme) assigned to `x` in the environment, then instantiate it (`lookup_env` does that).

3. **Lambda** (`ELambda (params, body)`)  
    ```ocaml
    | ELambda (params, body) ->
        let local_env = Hashtbl.copy env in
        (* Generate fresh type variables for each param, store in local_env *)
        ...
        TFun (param_tys, ret_ty)
    ```
    - We create a local copy of `env`.  
    - For each parameter name, create a fresh type variable `TVar(...)`, store as `(param -> that scheme)` in the local environment.  
    - Infer the body’s type.  
    - Produce `TFun (param_tys, body_type)`.

4. **Function Application** (`EApp (fn_expr, arg_exprs)`)  
    ```ocaml
    | EApp (fn_expr, arg_exprs) ->
        let fn_ty = infer_expr env fn_expr in
        let arg_tys = ...
        let ret_ty = fresh_tvar () in
        unify fn_ty (TFun (arg_tys, ret_ty));
        ret_ty
    ```
    - Infer the function’s type (`fn_ty`).  
    - Infer each argument’s type (`arg_tys`).  
    - Create a new fresh variable for the return type.  
    - Unify `fn_ty` with the function type `TFun(arg_tys, ret_ty)`.  
    - Return `ret_ty` as the type of the application.

5. **Conditional** (`EIf`)  
    ```ocaml
    | EIf (cond_expr, then_expr, else_expr) ->
        unify (infer_expr env cond_expr) TBool;
        let t1 = infer_expr env then_expr in
        let t2 = infer_expr env else_expr in
        unify t1 t2;
        t1
    ```
    - The condition must be `bool`.  
    - The `then_expr` and `else_expr` must unify, so they share the same type. We unify `t1` with `t2`. The result is that type.

6. **While** (`EWhile`)  
    ```ocaml
    | EWhile (cond_expr, body_expr) ->
        unify (infer_expr env cond_expr) TBool;
        ignore (infer_expr env body_expr);
        TUnit
    ```
    - We unify the condition with `TBool`.  
    - We infer the body but ignore its type. We return `TUnit`.

7. **Sequence** (`ESequence (e1, e2)`)  
    - We infer `e1` but discard its result, then infer and return `e2`’s type.

8. **Let-In** (`ELetIn (x, rhs, body)`)  
    ```ocaml
    | ELetIn (x, rhs, body) ->
        let rhs_ty = infer_expr env rhs in
        let local = Hashtbl.copy env in
        add_to_env local x rhs_ty;
        infer_expr local body
    ```
    - We infer `rhs_ty`.  
    - We make a local copy of `env` and store `x` → `rhs_ty` (actually as a polymorphic scheme via `add_to_env`).  
    - We infer `(body)` under that extended environment.

9. **Let-Rec** (`ELetRec (bindings, body)`)  
    ```ocaml
    | ELetRec (bindings, body) ->
        let local = Hashtbl.copy env in
        (* Step 1: Prepare each function name with a fresh TVar in local env *)
        List.iter bindings ~f:...
        (* Step 2: Infer each binding and unify with its TVar *)
        List.iter bindings ~f:...
        (* Step 3: infer body in local env *)
        infer_expr local body
    ```
    This pattern handles mutually recursive functions. Each binding gets a fresh type variable initially, and we unify that variable with the actual type of its RHS.

10. **Match** (`EMatch (scrut, cases)`)  
    ```ocaml
    | EMatch (scrut, cases) ->
        let s_ty = infer_expr env scrut in
        let result_ty = fresh_tvar () in
        List.iter cases ~f:(fun (pat, rhs) ->
            let localEnv = Hashtbl.copy env in
            let pat_ty = infer_pattern localEnv pat in
            unify s_ty pat_ty;
            let rt = infer_expr localEnv rhs in
            unify rt result_ty);
        result_ty
    ```
    - We infer the scrutinee’s type (`s_ty`).  
    - Create a fresh variable for the overall match result.  
    - For each pattern `(pat, rhs)`, we:  
        - Create a local environment (so new variables in the pattern don’t leak to the outer scope).  
        - `infer_pattern localEnv pat` → `pat_ty`. Then unify `s_ty` with `pat_ty` so the scrutinee and pattern share the same type.  
        - Infer the `rhs` → `rt`. Unify `rt` with `result_ty` (so each branch returns the same type).  
    - Return `result_ty`.

11. **Records** (`ERecord fields`)  
    ```ocaml
    | ERecord fields ->
        let row =
            List.fold_right fields ~init:REmpty ~f:(fun (fld, fexpr) acc ->
            let fty = infer_expr env fexpr in
            RExtend (fld, fty, acc))
        in
        TRecord row
    ```
    - We build a row type from the list of `(field_name, field_expr)` pairs. The result is a `TRecord row`.

12. **Field Get / Field Set** (`EFieldGet`, `EFieldSet`)  
    ```ocaml
    | EFieldGet (obj_expr, field) ->
        let obj_ty = infer_expr env obj_expr in
        let field_ty = fresh_tvar () in
        let leftover = fresh_rvar () in
        unify obj_ty (TRecord (RExtend (field, field_ty, RVar leftover)));
        field_ty
    ```
    - We unify the object’s type with a record containing at least `field`. That forces the object to be a record type with that field’s type.  
    - `EFieldSet` is similar but we unify the new value’s type with the row for `field`.

13. **Polymorphic Variant** (`EVariant (tag, exprs)`)  
    ```ocaml
    | EVariant (tag, exprs) ->
        let arg_tys = List.map exprs ~f:(infer_expr env) in
        let leftover = fresh_pvvar () in
        TPolyVariant { bound = AtLeast; tags = [ tag, arg_tys ]; leftover = Some leftover }
    ```
    - If you write something like `` `Tag(3, true) ``, we produce a polyvariant with that single tag, argument types `[TInt, TBool]`, and an open leftover for extension.  

14. **Arrays** (`EArray`, `EArrayGet`, `EArraySet`)  
    - **`EArray elts`**: unify all element expressions to the same type, store in `TArray(eltType)`.  
    - **`EArrayGet (arr_expr, idx_expr)`**: unify `idx_expr` with `TInt`, unify `arr_expr` with `TArray(someElementType)`, return that element type.  
    - **`EArraySet (arr_expr, idx_expr, v_expr)`**: unify `idx_expr` with `TInt`, unify `arr_expr` with `TArray(v_expr’s type)`, result is `TUnit`.

15. **References** (simplified demo):
    - `ERef e1`, `ESetRef (r, v)`, `EDeref r` are shown returning `TUnit` in the sample code, but in a real system, they might unify with `TRef(elementType)`. The example is minimal.

## 2) Pattern Inference: `infer_pattern`

```ocaml
and infer_pattern (env : (string, scheme) Hashtbl.t) (p : pattern) : ttype =
    match p with
    | PWildcard -> fresh_tvar ()
    | PVar x ->
        let tv = fresh_tvar () in
        Hashtbl.set env ~key:x ~data:(Scheme ([], tv));
        tv
    | PInt _ -> TInt
    | PBool _ -> TBool
    | PFloat _ -> TFloat
    | PString _ -> TString
    | PVariant (tag, subpats) ->
        let subtys = List.map subpats ~f:(infer_pattern env) in
        let leftover = fresh_pvvar () in
        TPolyVariant { bound = AtLeast; tags = [ tag, subtys ]; leftover = Some leftover }
```

### 2.1 Explanation of Pattern Cases

1. **`PWildcard`** `(_)`:
    - Yields a fresh type variable. The wildcard can match anything.

2. **`PVar x`**:
    - We allocate a fresh type variable for `x`, store it in the environment under `x` → that `TVar`. The pattern’s type is that variable.

3. **`PInt i`**, `PBool b`, `PFloat f`, `PString s`:
    - Literal constants in a pattern are specialized to that literal’s type. Example: `PInt 3` is `TInt`.

4. **`PVariant (tag, subpats)`**:
    - If we have a pattern like `` `SomeVar(x, _) `` we:  
        - Infer sub-patterns recursively with `infer_pattern env`. This yields a list of subpattern types.  
        - We produce a `TPolyVariant` with that single tag. Because it’s a pattern, we typically set `bound = AtLeast` so it can unify with a broader variant. We also create a leftover for extension.  

Hence, if we write:
```
PVariant("Cons", [PVar "hd"; PVar "tl"])
```
we get something like:
```
TPolyVariant { bound=AtLeast; tags=[("Cons", [fresh_tvar_for_hd, fresh_tvar_for_tl])]; leftover=Some leftover_id }
```
which unifies with any variant that has `` `Cons(...) `` plus possibly more tags.

## 3) Interaction Between `infer_expr` and `infer_pattern`

- **`EMatch (scrut, cases)`** calls `infer_expr` on the scrutinee → `s_ty`.  
- For each `(pattern, rhs)`, we do `infer_pattern` on `pattern` → `pat_ty` and unify it with `s_ty`.  
- Then we type-check the `rhs` and unify its result with a fresh, per-match `result_ty`. That ensures every branch of `match` yields the same type.

---

## 4) Summary

- **`infer_expr`**: 
    - Transforms each expression node into a type, assigning fresh type variables and unifying where necessary.  
    - Covers function definitions, applications, conditionals, loops, records, variants, arrays, references, etc.  
    - Ensures correct usage constraints (like an `if` condition must be `bool`, or array index must be `int`).  

- **`infer_pattern`**:
    - Infers the type of each `pattern`.  
    - Introduces fresh type variables for wildcard/pvar patterns and sets them in the local environment.  
    - Produces literal-specific types for integer, bool, float, or string patterns.  
    - Constructs a single-tag polymorphic variant type for `PVariant`.

These mechanisms, combined with the unification engine, yield a robust type inference system reminiscent of ML/Hindley–Milner style. By carefully handling environment scoping, fresh type variables, and unification constraints, the system can infer types for complex features like recursion, records, or polymorphic variants without explicit type annotations.

Below is a deeper explanation of how the **`infer_stmt`** function works in `chatml_typechecker.ml`. This function processes *top-level statements* (or language constructs that appear at the statement level rather than within an expression). These include let-bindings, recursive let, modules, and so on. The function updates the type environment in-place as it infers the statements’ types.
		
---

## 1) The `infer_stmt` Function

```ocaml
let rec infer_stmt (env : (string, scheme) Hashtbl.t) (s : stmt) : unit =
    match s with
    | SLet (x, e) ->
    let t = infer_expr env e in
    add_to_env env x t

    | SLetRec bindings ->
    List.iter bindings ~f:(fun (nm, _) ->
        Hashtbl.set env ~key:nm ~data:(Scheme ([], fresh_tvar ())));
    List.iter bindings ~f:(fun (nm, rhs_expr) ->
        let rhs_ty = infer_expr env rhs_expr in
        let (Scheme (_, tv)) = Hashtbl.find_exn env nm in
        unify rhs_ty tv)

    | SModule (mname, stmts) ->
    let menv = Hashtbl.copy env in
    let keys_before = Set.of_list (module String) (Hashtbl.keys menv) in
    List.iter stmts ~f:(infer_stmt menv);
    let keys_after = Set.of_list (module String) (Hashtbl.keys menv) in
    let new_keys = Set.diff keys_after keys_before in
    let new_fields =
        Set.to_list new_keys
        |> List.map ~f:(fun k -> k, Hashtbl.find_exn menv k)
    in
    let mod_ty = TModule new_fields in
    Hashtbl.set env ~key:mname ~data:(Scheme ([], mod_ty))

    | SOpen _mname ->
    (* Not implemented in this example *)
    raise (Type_error "Open not implemented in this example.")

    | SExpr e ->
    ignore (infer_expr env e)
```

### 1.1 Type and Parameter Explanation
- **`env : (string, scheme) Hashtbl.t`**: The type environment, mapping variable names (strings) to schemes. Each scheme can be a polymorphic type or a monomorphic type with some free variables.  
- **`s : stmt`**: A top-level statement in the DSL. The statements include:
    - `SLet (x, e)`
    - `SLetRec [(x1, e1); (x2, e2); ...]`
    - `SModule (mname, stmts)`
    - `SOpen mname`
    - `SExpr e`

The function returns `unit` because it updates the environment in place rather than returning a new environment.

---

## 2) Match Cases in `infer_stmt`

### 2.1 `SLet (x, e)`
```ocaml
| SLet (x, e) ->
    let t = infer_expr env e in
    add_to_env env x t
```
1. We call `infer_expr env e` to infer the type `t` of expression `e`.
2. We then invoke `add_to_env env x t`, which:
    - Computes the free type variables of `t`.
    - Checks free variables in the current environment.
    - Produces a polymorphic scheme (if possible) for `x`.
    - Stores `(x => scheme_for_t)` into the environment `env`.

Result: A new binding `x` is introduced in `env` with the type of `e` (potentially generalized).

---

### 2.2 `SLetRec bindings`
```ocaml
| SLetRec bindings ->
    List.iter bindings ~f:(fun (nm, _) ->
    Hashtbl.set env ~key:nm ~data:(Scheme ([], fresh_tvar ())));
    List.iter bindings ~f:(fun (nm, rhs_expr) ->
    let rhs_ty = infer_expr env rhs_expr in
    let (Scheme (_, tv)) = Hashtbl.find_exn env nm in
    unify rhs_ty tv)
```
1. First, we loop through each `(nm, _)` in `bindings`. For each named function/variable, we allocate a fresh type variable and store it in the environment. This step ensures each name can refer to one another—even before we know their actual types—allowing for mutual recursion.
2. Next, we loop again, actually calling `infer_expr` on each `rhs_expr`. We unify the result `rhs_ty` with the already-allocated type variable `tv` for that name. This “ties the knot” so that the final type must match the function body.

Example:
```ocaml
SLetRec [
    ("fact", ELambda(["n"], ...))
]
```
- We store `"fact"` -> `Scheme([], TVar alpha)` initially.  
- Then we infer the body of `fact`. Suppose it results in `(TFun([TInt], TInt))`, which we unify with `TVar alpha`. Hence `"fact"` is updated to have that function type.

---

### 2.3 `SModule (mname, stmts)`
```ocaml
| SModule (mname, stmts) ->
    let menv = Hashtbl.copy env in
    let keys_before = Set.of_list (module String) (Hashtbl.keys menv) in
    List.iter stmts ~f:(infer_stmt menv);
    let keys_after = Set.of_list (module String) (Hashtbl.keys menv) in
    let new_keys = Set.diff keys_after keys_before in
    let new_fields =
    Set.to_list new_keys |> List.map ~f:(fun k -> k, Hashtbl.find_exn menv k)
    in
    let mod_ty = TModule new_fields in
    Hashtbl.set env ~key:mname ~data:(Scheme ([], mod_ty))
```
1. We create `menv`, a copy of the current environment. This local environment will be used to infer the statements inside the module.
2. We record which keys (variables, functions) exist in `menv` before inferring the module’s statements (`keys_before`).
3. We then call `infer_stmt menv` on each statement in `stmts`. This modifies `menv` by adding new bindings (e.g., `SLet`, `SLetRec`) within the module’s scope.
4. After processing all statements, we gather the new keys that did not exist before (`new_keys` = `keys_after - keys_before`).
5. We build a `TModule new_fields` type, essentially capturing only the new bindings as the module’s exported fields.
6. Finally, we insert `(mname => TModule new_fields)` into the original environment `env`, wrapped in a scheme (with no bound type variables in this simple approach).

This means `mname` in the outer scope references a module whose fields are whatever was newly introduced inside the module block.

---

### 2.4 `SOpen _mname`
```ocaml
| SOpen _mname ->
    raise (Type_error "Open not implemented in this example.")
```
- In an ML-like language, `open M` might bring all the fields from module `M` into the current scope.  
- This feature is unimplemented here, so it throws an error if used.

---

### 2.5 `SExpr e`
```ocaml
| SExpr e ->
    ignore (infer_expr env e)
```
- This is a top-level statement that is just an expression (for side effects or immediate evaluation).
- We infer its type (to ensure it’s valid) but ignore the result, making no new top-level binding.

Example use might be for debugging or an interactive shell environment where you just type an expression to evaluate it at the top level (though in many static MLs, an expression at top-level still is valid to run or check).

---

## 3) Summary

1. **`SLet (x, e)`** and **`SLetRec`** are crucial for introducing new variables, either simple or mutually recursive. In both cases, we rely on `infer_expr` to find the right-hand side’s type, then store it in the environment, potentially generalizing it.
2. **`SModule (mname, stmts)`** creates a nested environment to typecheck module contents, then accumulates the new definitions into a `TModule` type. We store that module in the outer environment under `mname`.
3. **`SOpen _mname`** is not implemented in this example, but would typically merge fields from the module into the current environment.
4. **`SExpr e`** checks an expression at statement level and discards its result.

Together, these statement-handling functions enable the DSL to have modules, let-bindings, and toplevel expressions in addition to the expression forms covered by `infer_expr`. By calling `infer_stmt` in sequence over a program, we accumulate typing information and ensure the entire program is consistently typed.
