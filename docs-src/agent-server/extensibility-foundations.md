# ChatML extension records and capability discovery

The extension record and transaction foundations are implemented. Model-visible
one-off scripts, moderator tools, subscription adapters and generated-child tools
are still under implementation; none of their feature flags is enabled yet.
This page describes the available storage and client protocol contracts, not a
runnable extension tutorial.

## Capability discovery

`protocol.initialize` can return optional `extensions` metadata. Older responses
omit it. Both the metadata version and record codec version are currently 1;
unsupported versions fail decoding instead of dropping required information.
The catalog distinguishes known contracts from qualified host functionality:

- `chatml.invocations.v1`
- `chatml.background.v1`
- `chatml.notifications.v1`
- `agent.delegation.v1`
- `chatml.authoring.v1`

`available_features` is empty on current hosts. Negotiation intersects requested
features, server options and host qualification. Adding an extension string to
server options cannot activate an unfinished service. `server.info` applies the
same qualification filter. Capability discovery does not confer execution
permission; eventual tool admission must still check inherited authority.

Host identity distinguishes `daemon`, `embedded_durable`, `embedded_transient`
and the reserved `direct` host. Embedded sessions with an explicit data root use
`embedded_durable`; temporary data roots use `embedded_transient`. Host identity
and persistence lifetime are separate from the selected journal flush boundary:

| Journal mode | Acknowledgement boundary |
|---|---|
| `synced` | The journal append completes `Eio.File.sync` before success. |
| `buffered` | The append returns without a sync guarantee. |
| `memory` | Reserved for a host with no persistent journal. |

The current daemon maps both configured `each` and `interval` to a synced append;
`unsafe_buffered` maps to buffered. Embedded hosts also sync their journals, but
transient roots are removed on close. These facts do not promise durable external
execution, continuation replay or recovery of a deleted temporary root. A
process-restart test is not evidence of survival through power loss.

## Status snapshots and events

Snapshots have an additive `extension_status` list. Each version-1 summary contains
only its kind, typed identity, generation and lifecycle state. Missing fields on
older snapshots default to an empty list. Summaries omit tool arguments, results,
error text, schemas, capability fingerprints and arbitrary correlation text.
The server exposes them only to principals with `security.read`.

A changed projection is included in an existing durable `session.updated` event
as an optional `extension_status` field. It replaces the entire status list; an
empty list clears old state. Older clients can ignore the field and still advance
the event cursor. New clients decode strict kind-specific states and reject
ambiguous duplicate identities. Replacement snapshots and ordinary snapshots use
the same scope filter. Identical repeated terminal commits produce no extra
status update or history insertion.

## Durable records and atomic commits

Invocations retain admission context separately from their initial outcome and
provider-history publication. Subscriptions retain an originating invocation,
expiry, epoch and one immutable terminal winner. Deliveries retain a completion,
source, wake policy, attempt and one history identity. The session aggregate
checks ownership, generation and cross-record acknowledgement/result correlation.
One terminal work item has one delivery owner.

Session state schema 4 upgrades schema 2 with empty extension records and schema 3
with its invocation records preserved. Inconsistent old fields and unknown future
schemas fail closed. Snapshot, journal and compaction archive restoration apply
the same version checks. An older binary is not a supported reader of schema 4;
retain compatible backups before testing a binary rollback.

The host-internal `Session_actor.commit_extensions` operation atomically commits
record changes, moderator state, queued work intents and notification publication.
It requires the expected session revision and generation. The actor installs
state and broadcasts events only after persistence succeeds. It is not an RPC or
an authorization boundary. No external effect is rolled back by rejecting a local
transaction.

Publication uses `Runtime_notification(delivery_id)` provenance and commits its
history entry and receipt together. It requires the originating initial response
to be published. The current foundation permits publication only while the
session is running and idle; active-turn safe-point delivery and provider data
framing remain unfinished execution-service work.

## Recovery classifications

These classifications define the execution-service recovery work. Record replay
and local transaction deduplication are implemented; automatic reconciliation of
all execution states is not yet available.

| Retained state | Required recovery action |
|---|---|
| No committed invocation | Retry admission with the same request identity. |
| Admitted or dispatching, no result | Determine whether execution began; preserve interruption or uncertainty rather than fabricate success. |
| Committed queued intent, no launch | Reconcile claim and launch; do not execute arbitrary effects twice. |
| Initial outcome resolved, unpublished | Publish/reconcile the retained response without rerunning its handler. |
| Published pending acknowledgement | Continue tracking its owned job or subscription. |
| Terminal work, pending delivery | Retain the business result; deliver only at an eligible history boundary. |
| Committed notification | Replay its existing history identity; never insert a second copy. |
| Failed delivery | Allow explicit bounded delivery retry; do not repeat external work. |
| Interrupted external execution or approval continuation | Report interrupted/uncertain state; retry only under an explicit safe or idempotent policy. |

Active and unresolved records must not be removed to meet a retention target.
Notification text and delivery receipts have different lifetimes: compacting text
does not clear the committed receipt. Full reset, shutdown and restart reconciliation
are part of the remaining recovery implementation.
